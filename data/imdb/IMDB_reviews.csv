"the shawshank redemption is without a doubt one of the most brilliant movies i have ever seen. similar to the green mile in many respects (and better than it in almost all of them)  these two movies have shown us that stephen king is a master not only of horror but also of prose that shakes the soul and moves the heart. the plot is average  but king did great things with it in his novella that are only furthered by the direction  and the acting is so top-rate it's almost scary.tim robbins plays andy dufrane  wrongly imprisoned for 20 years for the murder of his wife. the story focuses on andy's relationship with ""red"" redding (morgan freeman  in probably his best role) and his attempts to escape from shawshank. bob gunton is positively evil and frightening as warden norton  and there are great performances and cameos all around; the most prominent one being gil bellows (late as billy of ally mcbeal) as tommy  a fellow inmate of andy's who suffers under the iron will of norton.if you haven't seen this movie  go and rent it now. you will not be disappointed. it is positively the best movie of the '90's  and one of my top 3 of all time. this movie is a spectacle to move the mind  soul  and heart. 10/10"
"the shawshank redemption is written and directed by frank darabont. it is an adaptation of the stephen king novella rita hayworth and shawshank redemption. starring tim robbins and morgan freeman  the film portrays the story of andy dufresne (robbins)  a banker who is sentenced to two life sentences at shawshank state prison for apparently murdering his wife and her lover. andy finds it tough going but finds solace in the friendship he forms with fellow inmate ellis ""red"" redding (freeman). while things start to pick up when the warden finds andy a prison job more befitting his talents as a banker. however  the arrival of another inmate is going to vastly change things for all of them.there was no fanfare or bunting put out for the release of the film back in 94  with a title that didn't give much inkling to anyone about what it was about  and with columbia pictures unsure how to market it  shawshank redemption barely registered at the box office. however  come academy award time the film received several nominations  and although it won none  it stirred up interest in the film for its home entertainment release. the rest  as they say  is history. for the film finally found an audience that saw the film propelled to almost mythical proportions as an endearing modern day classic. something that has delighted its fans  whilst simultaneously baffling its detractors. one thing is for sure  though  is that which ever side of the shawshank fence you sit on  the film continues to gather new fans and simply will never go away or loose that mythical status.it's possibly the simplicity of it all that sends some haters of the film into cinematic spasms. the implausible plot and an apparent sentimental edge that makes a nonsense of prison life  are but two chief complaints from those that dislike the film with a passion. yet when characters are this richly drawn  and so movingly performed  it strikes me as churlish to do down a human drama that's dealing in hope  friendship and faith. the sentimental aspect is indeed there  but that acts as a counterpoint to the suffering  degradation and shattering of the soul involving our protagonist. cosy prison life you say? no chance. the need for human connection is never more needed than during incarceration  surely? and given the quite terrific performances of robbins (never better) & freeman (sublimely making it easy)  it's the easiest thing in the world to warm to andy and red.those in support aren't faring too bad either. bob gunton is coiled spring smarm as warden norton  james whitmore is heart achingly great as the ""birdman of shawshank "" clancy brown is menacing as antagonist capt. byron hadley  william sadler amusing as heywood & mark rolston is impressively vile as bogs diamond. then there's roger deakins' lush cinematography as the camera gracefully glides in and out of the prison offering almost ethereal hope to our characters (yes  they are ours). the music pings in conjunction with the emotional flow of the movie too. thomas newman's score is mostly piano based  dovetailing neatly with andy's state of mind  while the excellently selected soundtrack ranges from the likes of hank williams to the gorgeous le nozze di figaro by mozart.if you love shawshank then it's a love that lasts a lifetime. every viewing brings the same array of emotions - anger - revilement - happiness - sadness - inspiration and a warmth that can reduce the most hardened into misty eyed wonderment. above all else  though  shawshank offers hope - not just for characters in a movie - but for a better life and a better world for all of us. 10/10"
the godfather is one of the very few films that doesn't have a single flaw.  seeing the godfather for the first time was the most amazing movie experiences of my life.  there's scenes that stay with you when the movies over  and you don't forget them.   everyone makes the mistake of calling this film a movie about crime.  its really a movie about family.  the dialogue is just unbelievable.  i've seen the movie at least 30  40 times  and i'm still amazed at how perfect it is.  the music  the acting  everything.  people think that citizen kane is the greatest movie ever made...well  there's no way  that anyone can think that citizen kane is more moving  and has a better storyline than the godfather.  the thing i find so amazing about the godfather is how michael (al pacino) changes throughout the movie.   its my opinion that this is the greatest movie ever made  and i doubt that anyone can watch this movie  and think i'm crazy.
"'the godfather' is the pinnacle of flawless films! the first time i viewed 'the godfather' i was in my early teens and it was the most astounding film i had ever seen  and has since then stood as my all-time favourite film. it is due to this that i have been looking forward to writing a review of this unforgettable classic. so let's start from the beginning. the film opens to four words  'i believe in america'  it's crazy to think that this simple line has become a resonant quote solely due to the impact it made on the entrance to the film's ""threshold"". this is just one of the many renowned quotes that litter the film  and believe me  there are a lot. after the first take we are then absorbed into the life of vito corleone  brilliantly portrayed by the oscar- winning performance of marlon brando. vito is a feared man  he is a criminal  he is a mafioso  but above all he is a respected family man  his three sons are depicted by three excellent actors  james caan  john cazale and al pacino as well as his adopted child tom hagen  played by robert duvall. the film follows vito as he attempts to transfer his crime empire to his reluctant son  michael. with some of the most graphic and gruesome death scenes to have ever been seen in the 1970's film industry (including a certain horse's head)  'the godfather' epitomises how violence can be used effectively within a film. the corleone's are some of the greatest antiheroes to have ever been seen on screen  whilst they are villains  the audience will refuse to accept that fact  coppola does something simple and audacious  he takes the guilt out of organised crime. a film rife with beautiful cinematography  memorable musical scores and well-paced action and drama. overall  the godfather is one of hollywood's greatest critical and commercial successes that gets everything right; a gangster flick that is overflowing with life  rich with emotion and subtle acting  and further blessed with amazing direction from francis ford coppola. arguably the most unforgettable masterpiece to have ever been made."
"dark  yes  complex  ambitious. christopher nolan and his co-writer jonathan nolan deserve a standing ovation. i don't usually go for loud movies filled with mindless gore and violence. ""the dark knight"" is certainly loud and violent but it's not mindless. it has depth and soul. even the joker  in an extraordinary creation by heath ledger  is deeply human. the natural petulance of christian bale makes his ego and alter ego the most fascinating and complex of all film superheroes. part of the genius of this movie is that batman himself  in screen time  is not really the lead. my attention was captivated by heath ledger and he determines and inspires the breathtaking atmosphere that envelopes gotham as well as us. the aplomb of christopher nolan as a director is mind blowing and his secret  i believe  is his obvious respect for his audience. what he's done is to elevate a popular genre into shakesperean proportions. bravo!"
confidently directed  dark  brooding  and packed with impressive action sequences and a complex story  the dark knight includes a career-defining turn from heath ledger as well as other oscar worthy performances  tdk remains not only the best batman movie  but comic book movie ever created.
"i'm not an al pacino fan but this movie has the best performance of al. i think no one in the history of world cinema has played a character better than al pacino in godfather 2. he deserved an oscar.
godfather 2 is better than the first part. it is a great sequel  it expands the themes and the world of the first part. robert de niro is stunning as usual. missed marlon brando. best part of this movie is it shows the rise of vito corleone and michael corleone contrasting their times and personalities.
you need to watch godfather 2"
"coppola's masterpiece is rivaled only by ""the godfather  part ii"" in which the 1940s setting of the first movie is extended backwards and forwards to reveal the corrupting effect of power...the film  breathtaking in its scope and tragic grandeur  shows two parallel stories extending two different time periods: the early career of young vito corleone seen first around the turn of the 20th century in sicily  and then in 1917  building his criminal underworld in the italian ghettos of new york city  post world war i  plus that of his son  michael (al pacino) desperately trying to keep his family together...al pacino's performance is quiet and solemn... he is cold and ruthless  with a whole contrast from the idealistic innocent war hero we initially met at the beginning of the first film... here he's a calculating and frightening force  seeking to expand casinos into pre-revolutionary cuba and consolidating an empire surrounded by perfidy and treason  maintaining total confidence in his ability to control the situation whether testifying before enraging senators or trying to outface his worst enemies...the film's haunting final shot of a lonely  isolated paranoid michael in his empty compound  is an unforgettable movie scene  a tragic portrait of a lonely and fully damned person  emotionally empty and finished  far from a waspish wife  more distant from a faithful lawyer...de niro's rise  from an orphan child by a family feud back in italy to a hood in new york and his position as a respected don  provides a welcome break from pacino's relentless attitude... since the people he kills seem to deserve it  vito comes off better than michael does  and it was wise of coppola to shuffle the two stories together despite lengthy flashbacks and the disturbance of continuity...the entire cast contributes greatly to the success of the film: lee strasberg  a fascinating mixture of lust and ruthlessness; g. d. spradlin  absolutely right as the sinister and corrupt nevada senator; michael v. gazzo  unforgettable as the troubled gray-haired informer; gastone moschin  excellent as the blackmailer in white suit; john cazale  marvelously timid as the vague  confused  and hesitant fredo; diane keaton  clearly irrational as the long-suffering wife kay; talia shire  too extravagant as the lousy mother; troy donahue too ambitious as the fortune-hunting suitor; and robert duvall excels as the confidant  and retainer to the all-powerful corleone family...coppola's motion picture is not just a mere supply with new characters and events from the original  it's a far more complex and intimate movie than its predecessor... it is not really a sequel... it's just more... it cleverly shifts in time between two distinct narratives with extreme realistic violence and criminal mentality of gangsters..."
i am  i admit  an unlikely convert to the religion of tolkienism. i  have never read the books  having  i thought  been put off them for  life by the sort of obsessive freaks who read them when i was at  school. (one classmate  then aged about sixteen  told me with great  pride that he had read the whole of 'the lord of the rings' at least  fifty times). i also have never been a great admirer of the 'sword and  sorcery' school of fantasy writing or film-making; indeed  some of this  genre (mostly those starring the current governor of california) struck  me as being among the worst films ever made.  i was  however  persuaded to see the first in the trilogy  'the  fellowship of the ring'  by its overwhelmingly positive reception from  the critics  and was quickly won over by the scope of peter jackson's  vision. i had been expecting some twee tale of elves  gnomes and  fairies; what i experienced was a genuine epic (in the true sense of  that overused word). ever since december 2001  i have been waiting for  parts two and three of the trilogy to be released. neither has  disappointed me.  the story of 'the lord of the rings' is too complex to be told in a  review such as this. suffice it to say that it revolves around a magic  ring which will give its possessor immense power. the power-hungry dark  lord sauron (a figure who is never actually seen on screen) desires to  obtain the ring in order to dominate middle earth. his enemies  led by  the wizard gandalf  are seeking to destroy the ring  which can only be  used for evil purposes  not for good. at the beginning of the final  part of the trilogy  sauron's forces are massing for an attack on the  kingdom of gondor.  the film relates the story of the conflict which follows  and this  leads to some of the most spectacular battle sequences i have seen   even more impressive than those in 'the two towers'. inevitably  the  film makes much use of computer-generated effects  but unlike many  films dominated by special effects  plot and character are not  neglected. the acting is uniformly good  and in some cases outstanding.  special mentions must also go to the camera-work  which made the best  possible use of the magnificent new zealand scenery  and to howard  shore's memorable musical score.  so  looking forward to the oscar ceremony  i have no doubt that this  should be the best film and that peter jackson  who has amply fulfilled  the promise shown in the excellent 'heavenly creatures'  should be best  director. best actor? i would find it difficult to decide between the  competing claims of sir ian mckellen  who brings wisdom  kindliness and  the required touch of steel to his portrait of gandalf  and of elijah  wood  who plays the brave and resourceful hobbit frodo to whom falls  the dangerous task of ensuring the ring's destruction. best supporting  actor? my own nomination would be for sean astin  as frodo's loyal  companion sam  but several others might have claims  notably viggo  mortensen or bernard hill.  is this the best movie ever made  as some of its admirers have claimed?  possibly not- that is  after all  a very large claim to make. i have no  doubt  however  that the trilogy as a whole is the first great  cinematic masterpiece of the twenty-first century. it has certainly  inspired me to start reading tolkien's original novels. 10/10.
i've just re-watched the lord of the rings trilogy for the 1000th time tonight... nearly 15 years since the fellowship of the rings was released... i still haven't seen a movie that's better  nor close  to any of these three films. the casting is perfection as well as the incredible acting by everyone in the movie. i can still watch these movies back to back and not get bored. they are a light to this world and wouldn't be the same without them.i miss the good old lotr's days. the best movies ever created. the return of the king was the best way to end a thrilling journey through middle earth!
"conflicted on this one. i like a lot of elements of it  the characters are (mostly) really compelling and interesting. i think some of the ""segments"" are a lot stronger than others. i think that the first part of bruce willis's story is just... bland. i didn't find it very interesting or compelling. it gets interesting though. the first and last are by far my favourite  but for the most part it's pretty strong. i do think this film is slightly overrated. that's not to say that it isn't good  but i think a lot of people think it is a whole lot better then it is. the film is acted well and i enjoyed all the action  not to mention the comedy in this film caught me by surprise. i found it really hilarious. i see why everyone had/has a crush on uma thurman now  she really is deserving of the main character on the cover. i also remembered how much i like long shots. i think they allow exposition to be delivered in a way that is more pleasing to the audience. overall  good crime flick with some great comedy and action but a tad overrated. 7-8/10."
"one of the early scenes in ""pulp fiction"" features two hit-men discussing what a big mac is called in other countries. their dialogue is witty and entertaining  and it's also disarming  because it makes these two thugs seem all too normal. if you didn't know better  you might assume these were regular guys having chit-chat on their way to work. other than the comic payoff at the end of the scene  in which they use parts of this conversation to taunt their victims  their talk has no relevance to anything in the film  or to anything else  for that matter. yet without such scenes  ""pulp fiction"" wouldn't be ""pulp fiction."" i get the sense that tarantino put into the film whatever struck his fancy  and somehow the final product is not only coherent but wonderfully textured.it's no wonder that fans spend so much time debating what was in the suitcase  reading far more into the story than tarantino probably intended. the film is so intricately structured  with so many astonishing details  many of which you won't pick up on the first viewing  that it seems to cry out for some deeper explanation. but there is no deeper explanation. ""pulp fiction "" is  as the title indicates  purely an exercise in technique and style  albeit a brilliant and layered one. containing numerous references to other films  it is like a great work of abstract art  or ""art about art."" it has all the characteristics we associate with great movies: fine writing  first-rate acting  unforgettable characters  and one of the most well-constructed narratives i've ever seen in a film. but to what end? the self-contained story does not seem to have bearing on anything but itself.the movie becomes a bit easier to understand once you realize that it's essentially a black comedy dressed up as a crime drama. each of the three main story threads begins with a situation that could easily form the subplot of any standard gangster movie. but something always goes wrong  some small unexpected accident that causes the whole situation to come tumbling down  leading the increasingly desperate characters to absurd measures. tarantino's originality stems from his ability to focus on small details and follow them where they lead  even if they move the story away from conventional plot developments.perhaps no screenplay has ever found a better use for digressions. indeed  the whole film seems to consist of digressions. no character ever says anything in a simple  straightforward manner. jules could have simply told yolanda  ""be cool and no one's going to get hurt "" which is just the type of line you'd find in a generic  run-of-the-mill action flick. instead  he goes off on a tangent about what fonzie is like. tarantino savors every word of his characters  finding a potential wisecrack in every statement and infusing the dialogue with clever pop culture references. but the lines aren't just witty; they are full of intelligent observations about human behavior. think of mia's statement to vincent  ""that's when you know you've found somebody special: when you can just shut the f--- up for a minute and comfortably enjoy the silence.""what is the movie's purpose exactly? i'm not sure  but it does deal a lot with the theme of power. marsellus is the sort of character who looms over the entire film while being invisible most of the time. the whole point of the big date sequence  which happens to be my favorite section of the film  is the power that marsellus has over his men without even being present. this power is what gets vincent to act in ways you would not ordinarily expect from a dumb  stoned gangster faced with an attractive woman whose husband has gone away. the power theme also helps explain one of the more controversial aspects of the film  its liberal use of the n-word. in this film  the word isn't just used as an epithet to describe blacks: jules  for instance  at one point applies the term to vincent. it has more to do with power than with race. the powerful characters utter the word to express their dominance over weaker characters. most of these gangsters are not racist in practice. indeed  they are intermingled racially  and have achieved a level of equality that surpasses the habits of many law-abiding citizens in our society. they resort to racial epithets because it's a patter that establishes their separateness from the non-criminal world.there's a nice moral progression to the stories. we presume that vincent hesitates to sleep with mia out of fear rather than loyalty. later  butch's act of heroism could be motivated by honor  but we're never sure. the film ends  however  with jules making a clear moral choice. thus  the movie seems to be exploring whether violent outlaws can act other than for self-preservation.still  it's hard to find much of a larger meaning tying together these eccentric set of stories. none of the stories are really ""about"" anything. they certainly are not about hit-men pontificating about burgers. nor is the film really a satire or a farce  although it contains elements of both. at times  it feels like a tale that didn't need to be told  but for whatever reason this movie tells it and does a better job than most films of its kind  or of any other kind."
this movie was sensational. it was a piece of art along with being informational. it told people about the holocaust  and it also told people about the human spirit. it shows how people can just triumph over anything with just some help from one person the things that spielberg did with the movie was incredible too. the black and white was genius  and how he had the little girl in red and the fire was phenuminal. i have never seen anything like it  schindler's list is beyond all words.
i have only ever seen this film once  i only ever want to see this film once and i will only ever need to see this film once. it is etched on my mind. i  like many others  left in silence.  i could not imagine inventing a critical analysis of this film  picking small points of detail or of style  or even scoring points off the director. it stands alone as a monumental piece of cinema  a magnificent accomplishment.
intense courtroom drama which has 12 very different people  all males  struggling with a murder case involving a young puerto rican boy that seems cut-and-dried. however  juror henry fonda does not believe it to be as sure-fire as it appears. he votes not guilty and what follows is a chain of events that will test the views  beliefs and thoughts of the other 11 members. fonda is great  but lee j. cobb steals every scene (and that is not easy to do in a film like this). ed begley  martin balsam  jack warden  jack klugman  joseph sweeney  e.g. marshall and john fiedler are among the other individuals caught in a situation that is much more difficult than it appears on the surface. an excellent character-study that should be studied and embraced by all present and future film-makers. 5 stars out of 5.
"an excellent courtroom drama with a unique twist. instead of following the trial itself  the viewer has a unique chance to observe the events behind the closed doors of a jury room. the film begins with the end of the trial. the jurors retire to deliberate the case. a preliminary vote is taken and the result is 11:1 in favour of the guilty verdict. eleven jurors have raised their hands to convict a young man of killing his father. only juror #8 has doubts. at first even he does not truly believe the young man to be innocent but notes (rightfully) that the case for the defence might have been presented in a more convincing manner and that the boy might be given the benefit of a doubt. since the boy is to be executed if found guilty his life is now in the hands of the jury and juror #8 reasons that the least they could do is talk about the case a bit. as time goes on some of the jurors change their minds and find that there is perhaps enough reasonable doubt not to convict the young man after all. but not everyone is easy to convince.although the plot of the film is excellent and it is fascinating to see what little things can influence which way a verdict goes  where this film really succeeds is in presenting the characters of the 12 jurors. the character of each of the jurors emerges through a wonderful mix of perfect casting  excellent dialogue and near-flawless acting.juror #1 - a simple man who clearly does not understand the full complexity of the task that lies before him but is trying to do everything not to let anyone else find this out. he appears at ease only once during the film - when he talks about football. he has the misfortune to be selected foreman of the jury - a task he clearly does not relish.juror #2 - a small  quite man  clearly unaccustomed to giving his own opinion much less to expecting his views to be of any importance. apparently he finds solace in his job - he is an accountant.juror #3 - probably the most complex personality in the film. starts off like a pleasant self-made successful businessman  he analyses the case impartially  explains his arguments well and is reasonably self assured. as time goes on he becomes more and more passionate and seems to be somehow personally involved with the case.  he also starts to show some signs of slight mental instability. wonderfully played by lee j. cobb - this is the character you remember after the film is over.juror #4 - self assured  slightly arrogant stockbroker. obviously considers himself more intelligent than anyone else in the room  he approaches the case with cool heartless logic but (as one of the jurors says - ""this is not an exact science"") he does not take into account the feelings  the passions  the characters of the people involved in the case. he is conspicuous by the fact that he is the only juror that does not take his jacket off (it is a very hot day).juror #5 - here is a man under great emotional stress. he comes from the same social background as the accused boy - with who he almost unwillingly seems to identify with. paradoxically this appears one of the main reasons for him voting guilty - he does not want compassion to influence him - so ironically it does.juror #6 - a simple man  quite readily admitting that everyone in the room is better qualified than he is to make decisions and offer explanations. but he really wants to see justice done and it worries him that he might make a mistake.juror #7 - the only one that really has no opinion on this case. literally throughout the film his thoughts are never on the case - he talks of baseball  of the heat  of fixing the fan but the only reason he has for voting this way or that is to speed things up a bit so he might be out of the jury room as soon as possible. not an evil man he just has no sense of morality whatsoever - he can tell right from wrong but does not seem to think it's worth the bother.juror #8- a caring man  has put more thought into the case than any of the other jurors. he tries to do his best even in the face of seemingly impossible odds.juror #9 - a wise old man with his great life experience has quite a unique way of looking at the case.juror #10 - the most horrifying character in the film. votes guilty and does not even try to hide the fact that he does so only because of the boy's social background. the tragedy comes from the fact that his own social position is only a cut above the boy's - which makes him all the more eager to accentuate the difference.juror #11 - an immigrant watchmaker  careful methodical man  well mannered and soft spoken. respects the right of people to have different opinion to his - and is willing to look at both sides of the problem. loses his temper only once - horrified by the complete indifference of juror #7.juror #12 - a young business type - perhaps he has his own opinions - but is careful to hide them. what he has learnt out of life seems to be that intelligence is equal with agreeing with what the majority of people think.the film succeeds in doing something very rare today - developing an intelligent plot while also developing 12 believable  memorable and distinct characters."
"i have to say to make such an impressive trailer and such an uninteresting film  takes some doing.here you have most of the elements that would make a very good film. you have great special effects  a sci-fi conundrum  beautiful visuals and good sound. yet the most important part of the film is missing. there is no plot  character or soul to this film. it's like having a beautiful building on the outside with no paint or decoration on the inside.it's an empty shell of a film. there is no tension; you couldn't care less about any of the characters  why were they even motivated to do what they did. helping a corporation get ""one over"" on another corporation is hardly saving the human race.when you operate in a dream environment  where you can't die or be injured really it means there is nothing to worry about  who cares what happens. all the explosions and actions sequences are just meaningless. by the way  why does hollywood still keep filming action scene's an inch away from every characters nose? it's impossible to see what's going on  so many films are ruined by this. watch and learn from the matrix  take the camera backwards a couple of feet and we can actually work out what's going on.so 2 and half hours of looking at my watch waiting for the very predictable ending  is a million miles from being a good film. how anyone in their right mind can give this 10/10  it's boring and pointless. a film has stir the soul  has to grab you  you need to feel for the characters. can anyone  honestly say  they cared about anyone on show here.by the way  here's an idea  why don't you bring the children (who haven't aged a minutes since you last saw them) to you  if you can't go to the us.i know the end scene was trying to be ambiguous  but the fact his father  who lives in paris  is bizarrely there in the us to meet him (how did he know) and the children look identical to every dream sequence they appeared in  means there wasn't much doubt.in the end there is nothing at stake for anyone  so a pointless movie. i suspect nolan will continue to get praise  but i can't really say i've got excited about any of his movies. they all leave me cold. they are not terrible  just there's nothing really there  no substance."
"my 3rd time watching this movie! yet  it still stunned my mind  kept me enjoyed its every moment and left me with many thoughts afterward.
for someone like me  who've rarely slept without dream  it's so exciting watching how christopher nolan had illustrated every single characteristic of dream on the big screen. as it's been done so sophisticatedly  i do believe the rumour that nolan had spent 10 years to finish the script of inception. in my opinion  it's been so far the greatest achievement in his brilliant writer-director career. i jumped into this conclusion after making a quick benchmark of nolan's remarkable works:
memento  as his first signature in the cinema history  is tremendous and has stayed the most mind-bending film i've ever seen. but overall  it doesn't reach the same level of inception.the prestige is highly impressive but somehow i haven't been able to find the very particular ""nolan's spirit"" in it.the batman trilogy is the best superhero saga of all time and its peak the dark knight is no doubt a masterpiece as well. nonetheless  every time we talk about it  heath ledger takes all the spotlights with his life-time-role: the (unique-and-only) joker.then there came inception where nolan truly stood out  having every single detail of his work done in the finest way. the multi-layered storyline despite its complexity  remains consistent and originally interesting. from visual aspect  everything was masterly handled: an impeccable cross-cutting allowed the movie to follow nolan's nonlinear story-telling without being scattered; a wonderful cinematography work completed with incredibly imaginative visual-effects brought into life so many breathtaking scenes  some of them  i believe  will stay in the audience's mind for a long time (city bending in paris  zero-gravity fight  in limbo  dreams collapsing...). in addition  nolan had also a solid cast ensemble to help him deliver all of his messages.later  we had interstellar. though i did admire its cinematography and visual-effects  the film itself is nowhere near the level of inception.
spoilers ahead !!!!! for all who haven't watched this movie  you may stop the reading right here because the following paragraphs contain a ton of spoilers!it is set in the world where there's technology that allows people to literally share dream. there is  in this world  a new kind of corporate spy - ""extractors"" who use this technology to infiltrate the target's subconscious and extract valuable information through a shared dream world. our hero mr cobb (leonardo dicaprio)  a very well-known extractor  and his partner arthur (joseph gordon-levitt) are approached by a powerful businessman - mr saito (ken watanabe) for a nearly impossible mission  something no one has ever done before : instead of steeling  he wants them to plant an idea in a person's subconscious  which is also called ""inception"". in return  saito offers something that cobb could never resist: a ticket to go home with his children by taking out the homicide charge against him. so cobb and arthur gather a team to carry out the mission: eames (tom hardy) - a veteran identity forger  yusuf - the only one chemist can make such a powerful sedative for such a complex 3-levels ""dream within a dream""  and ariadne (ellen page) - a newbie but remarkably talented architect whose role is critical for the success of the mission. the target is robert fischer (cillian murphy) - son and heir of saito's biggest competitor (maurice fischer  who's dying). the goal is to seed an idea into his mind which will make him abandon his father's business  and the team has to carry saito as visitor in their mission to let him verify the result of inception. while the team go deeper and deeper into fischer's mind  we discover gradually the dark of cobb's past  as well as the 2 biggest why concerning our hero: why he has became such an expert of inception and what is his desperate motivation for taking that insane mission.the movie is not only about the inception mission but more importantly  about the struggle of finding the way in the maze of life. in cobb's case  it's the maze of dreams built by his memories with his past wife mal (marion cotillard) and his regrets. so as long as he let himself consumed by the past by blaming himself for the death of his love wife  it will keep coming back and haunt his present: the deeper the team go into dream  the more dangerous his subconscious  under the form of his ghostly wife  comes out and could anytime jeopardize the mission. indeed  if we apprehend the movie with these 2 layers of its story  the ending scene makes perfect sense. yes! we're now talking about that famous ending which has still remained one of the most controversial movie endings in the cinema history. did cobb find mr saito in limbo  bring he back to complete the mission then come back to his children in the real world? or they are still stuck in limbo - the infinite dream world  and the last scene was just his big dream? but all of those question only matter in the first layer of the story: the result of inception mission. when we perceive the story in its deeper layer  as a journey for cobb to let go of his feeling of guilt for the past and re-find the meaning of his life  this ending did fulfill its job. cobb didn't even stay to see either if the spinning top would fall because he didn't care any more  what's important to him is that he gonna be with his kids. he did finally get rid of his haunting past and be able to move on  and that matters. and after all  dream or reality  the importance is to truly live. so from this point of view  he has solved the maze of his life.
some short lines about the cast:
leo has done justice to our main character but he did not success to make a leap from his previous similar roles in shutter island and blood diamond.joseph gordon-levitt could have been more intense  given the fact that he had the most astounding fight scene in the movie (zero-gravity sequence).there was something missing in ken watanabe's performance to portray the powerful man who sponsored the crazy mission. maybe it was his english...tom hardy was ok but forgettable because his character didn't have any memorable moment though he had a lot of screen time.ellen page was really impressive  she did fully illustrate the cleverness and the keenness of the young brilliant architect. and personally  i did find a lot of charms in her acting.cillian murphy has also done a great job. much more emotionally complex than just a target of the inception mission  his character robert fischer  at the end  was not so different than our hero cobb. they both were struggling to find a way out of their own maze. if for cobb  it was the painful past with his late wife; for fischer  it was the grand shadow and the lack of recognition of his late dad.last but not least  the one who impressed me the most was marion. mal was so beautiful and mysterious in a very unique haunting way  mostly with her speaking eyes! and for me  she is the most remarkable character of the movie."
would love to review but we all know rule 1.the end.
"fight club is one of those movies that hits the spot without missing an inch of it. the nameless narrator (edward norton) is an insomniac office worker who lives a materialistic life. from the very beginning the movie comments on the capitalist nature of society by portraiting how consumerism moves the world  but is unable to give relief in the end. flipping through catalogues of new furnite for his apartment were the narrator's only personality trait. to fight against his insomnia he starts attending to support groups. by lying to people  pretending he has conditions he does not have  the narrator finds relief - the emotional acceptance he finds in the support groups is enough to allow him to sleep at night. the emotional complexity of the character is nothing unrealistic. david fincher makes a subtle  yet clear  comment on the nature of materialist societies where no one really listens to each other nor care about each other. the system doesn't care about anyone  the distance between people - especially enhanced by how they function in the capitalist world - is a major plot point. however  when the narrator is finds someone who's a faker just like him he loses his emotional escape - "" her lie reflected my lie. suddenly  i felt nothing. i couldn't cry  so once again i couldn't sleep"".shortly after tyler durden (brad pitt) is introduced into the story  the main character loses everything he valued. deprived of his possessions he seeks solace in the company of a man who is the polar opposite of what he is. if the narrator is a worker who's way too worried about his condo and his job  tyler is a freewheeling soapmaker who couldn't care less about all those things. the contrast between them is clear; tyler refuses any consumerist logic from the narrator whilst making he see how futile is the lifestyle he was leading - ""right. we are consumers. we're the by-products of a lifestyle obsession."" the characters here portraid are so different because one of them is free  while the other is not. tyler  in a nihilistic way  helps the narrator realize that his existence is meaningless enough - something that is clearly displayed in the capitalist world - that all they can do is giving up everything. the self-destruction promoted by the fight club is ironically what allows the narrator - as well as many other frustrated men - to find solace in their mundane life. little by little the narrator is stripping himself off his previous beliefs about job  about behavior and the value of things. it's interesting to note that the narrator doesn't quit his job immediately  picturing how hard it is actually to cut ties with the system - he eventually does though.many subtopics are discussed through the movie. we see the narrator and tyler  now living together  talking about many things. they talk about how both had an absent father  how both lacked a sense of direction in life at some point and were told to follow the common sense - ""he says  'get a job'. so  i'm 25  i call again and say  'now what?' he says  'i dunno. get married"". the nature of the system we live in tells us what to do since the moment we're born  while both of them agree on that  they also agree that this is all a great waste of time. it's important to notice though that both them had no significant connections with other people  especially with women as tyler comments - ""we're a generation of men raised by women. i'm wondering if another woman is really the answer we need"".as the club grows the movie delves even deeper in those reflections about what really matters in life - ""advertising has us chasing cars and clothes  working jobs we hate so we can buy s**t we don't need"". tyler becomes the source of inspiration for everyone who attends to the fight club; everyone is much more like the narrator  but they're striving to be more like him. at some point  tyler decides that the club is meant to be something bigger - what he would call project mayhem. while the original fight club was something kept like a secret idealized to give some sort of freedom  through self-destruction  to its members  project mayhem is about declaring a fight against the system. the frustrated collective consciousness was the straw that broke the camel's back - ""we've all been raised on television to believe that one day we'd all be millionaires  and movie gods  and rock stars. but we won't. and we're slowly learning that fact. and we're very  very pi**ed off"". however  the narrator starts to slowly go against what tyler was meaning to do - kinda of recalling a bit of his past self and a sort of respect for the authority of society - and when this happen it's the moment the movie reaches its climax.the genius of the movie is displayed when we discover that tyler durden and the narrator are the same person  they have always been the same person. due to his declining mental health and his rather meaningless life  he created an alter-ego - someone capable of manifesting everything he wasn't as a system abiding person. the contrast created by tyler's different personalities is amazing to watch as the truth unfolds; and the ambivalence created when we discover the truth about tyler durden is even more marvelous. this movie portraits very well how a person can reach the extremes of their mind in a system that overlooks the relevance of your very existence - when you become just a number  just a braindead member of society  having your hopes and wishes constantly ignored. in the end tyler recovers his sanity only to see that his actions can't be reverted - so he only stands by and watches. the final scene is beautiful; what could be bettar than watching the system crumbling before your eyes while ""where is my mind"" plays? this movie is a masterpiece and it is so entrancing because of how real it is - in the end the movie shows many things we know and think but tend to keep hidden. it is provocative  funny and thrilling and most importantly: it is so damn real. the plot aged perfectly and i don't think it is going to get old so soon - this movie is a must watch."
"growing up  my dad would always tell me his favorite books were the lord of the rings volumes.  but i was never interested in fantasies  so i didn't really care.  then i found out that peter jackman was making the movies so i told my dad.  he became really excited.  but still  i didn't care.  until one night in november  when they showed the lotr special on tv.  i was able to catch only the first ten  fifteen minutes and instantly  i wanted to see the movie.  i had never read the books.  my dad took me and my family to see the movie.  i was a bit excited and curious to see how they would do it. mind you  i knew next to nothing about this story.i sat through the entire three hours in middle earth and fell in love with it. through parts  i would clutch on my brother's arm  tense and hoping that everyone will make it through a lot of the sticky situations they were in. i fell in love with legolas and his graceful elf self.  the minute the movie began  i was drawn in.  the special effects were terrific.  i felt like i was there.  i wanted (and still do) to live in rivendell among the elves. the backdrops for the movies was fantastic.  sir ian mckellan's quote about how new zealand is middle earth is so true.i was very impressed with the casting.  i'm a huge movie buff so i have seen plenty of movies and i won't be lying when i say that lotr has the best casting ever.  every person  the mains and the extras  was the character they played.  the make-up was incredible.  the orcs creeped me out.  the elves entranced me.  the hobbits brought a smile to my face.  elrond  hugo weaving  is the perfect elf king  firm and commanding  yet with love for his people and respect for frodo.  i could go on and on  but i won't.i loved the fact how pj was able to make the hobbits look small in every single scene.  i would love to know how in the world they did that.  i love how the elves are so graceful and look ethereal.i know that the movie is three hours long and people balk at that.  i took a friend of mine who hasn't seen the movie because it was three hours long. he loved it.  he was engrossed and he had never read the book either. this movie is one of the  if not the  finest piece of work i have seen.  i eagerly await ""the two towers"" and ""the return of the king"".  i definitely recommend this movie for everyone to see at least once.  i have seen it four times and will see it yet again soon.  i can never get bored of this movie. go.  see it.i leave you with a quote from gandalf: ""all we have to decide is what to do with the time that we are given"""
simply incredible. never before have i seen a 3 hour movie that didn't seem like 3 hours. i read the lord of the rings very recently and i was surprised at how similar peter jackson's vision was to my own.now about the omissions and alterations. i'm not a crazed fanatic who gets worked up over every little detail. i didn't mind arwen's inflation and i'm actually glad tom bombadil was scrubbed (i felt tom bombadil was an unnecessary addition to the book). despite these minor changes  the screenplay stays extremely close to the book and flows very very well (and the prologue was a nice touch).the acting was flawless. as i've read many many times in other reviews  mckellen doesn't play gandalf  he is gandalf. wood  mortensen  holm  astin  everyone was fantastic. my hat's off to sean bean who delivers an excellent performance as boromir  a character who's intentions are good but wrestles with the corrupting power of the ring. bean portrays it very well. oh  and andy serkis does a perfect gollum voice. it's exactly as i imagined it myself.the special effects were incredible  the cave troll  the balrog  gollum  and sauron's eye all looked amazing. i was also very impressed by the seamless shrinking of the vertically challenged characters.what's wrong with this movie? i have no idea... i thought everything was perfect. my biggest gripe is having to wait an entire year to see the two towers!
can't take credit for this gem. even if i am her mother.forest gump: movie review by josephineso  it's about this really stupid grown-up and there's blood and stuff and it's not appropriate for anyone else in my class  probably  but  you know  you guys let me watch stuff like this. what is up with that? and there's this really bad girl named jenny  and i hated her clothes. but once she cuts her hair she turns good again. and a guy with no legs  who was weird. he made shrimp  which is gross  except for the popcorn kind. he got a lot better when he cut his hair  too. i liked it. it was funny. can i watch it again tonight?
when i first saw this movie i didn't appreciate it like i do now. i think it may have been because i was so young when i first saw it. just recently i saw the movie again. what an amazing story and moving meaning. that movie teaches you so much about life and the meaning of it. that life isn't as bad as most people make it seem. that an innocent man can impact so many lives with his innocence. the meaning of the movie to me is that everyone needs to have a better outlook on life. that we need to appreciate more of the little things and not let the big things hold us back. that truly although life may throw us trials and tribulations like a box of chocolates but that we have to just bite into it and get through it even if we don't like it. that we all need to hold true to our values and not sink into a place that feels like there's no hope... i just love this movie. and anyone who hasn't seen it or who thinks that don't like it i seriously suggest seeing it or seeing it again. it truly is amazing...
"ok- first  as mentioned in another review  the geographic/historical errors in this film are glaring. you've got men carrying revolvers that look like old style cap-and-ball pistols  but they're loading them with metallic cartridges- historically about five years early. eastwood carries a rifle that hasn't been invented yet  tuco assembles a ""superpistol"" out of a colt  a remington  and a smith and wesson- impossible. and there was nothing of merit taking place between the north and south during the civil war in the southwest. now  that aside  i must say that this is the greatest western ever. i first saw this film when i was about ten. i'd never sat through an entire western befor  even though my dad watched them constantly. since then  i've been through film school  watched hundreds of westerns  learned to appreciate them- but nothing matches up to this. the searchers  stagecoach  gunfight at the o.k. corral  the gunfighter  high noon  shane- all great films  but saddled with the standard american western morality- the good guy never takes liberties with the eastern schoolmarm  the bad guy wears a black hat  etc. coming from italy  tg tb &tu isn't bound by these conventions. blondie's the ""good guy""- but he's also a bounty hunter. he makes a living in a highly immoral way  but is obviously the ""good""- not because we're told  but from small acts- giving the dying soldier a cigar  making sure the captain knows to hold on till he hears the bridge blow  the genuine regret he feel for having to let shorty die. and while angel eyes may be the bad  we at least know he has prinicpals- when he's hired for a job  he always sees the job through. and tuco may be more immoral than the other two  but he's so savvy and his role so humorous that one can't bring oneself to look upon him disfavorably. in other words  historical inaccuracies aside  tg  tb  & tu maybe one of the most accurate portrayals of the west ever put on film- there are no clear-cut lines of conduct  no black and white  or even grey  but just a swirled palette of various facets of the human condition."
a sprawling western epic that follows the adventures of three gunfighters looking for $200 000 in stolen gold  sergio leone's `the good  the bad  and the ugly' is a masterpiece  one that continues to get better and better with each viewing.  in a way  it's a morality play  weighing the consequences of good and evil  but it does so in a realistic manner.  sometimes  crime does pay  at least in the short term  and sometimes good does go unrewarded. this film probably signaled the death knell of the traditional john wayne `white hat/black hat' western.the three main characters make the film.  lee van cleef (`the bad') is evil personified.  totally ruthless  he'll do whatever it takes to get what he wants.  clint eastwood (`the good') is the man with no name  not really `good' in a traditional sense . . . but he has a certain sense of honor and tries to do the right thing.  (watch the scene when he gives a dying confederate soldier a puff of his cigar - powerful  and it sums up everything that the man with no name is all about  without saying a single word.)  eli wallach (`the ugly') is tuco  and he's easily the most complex - if not the best - character in the film.  all impulse and rage  tuco spins wildly throughout the movie  stealing  lying  pretending to be clint eastwood's best friend in one scene  trying to kill him in another - tuco truly represents `the ugly' side of people.the movie is long  but there's not a wasted scene in the film.  each one slowly lets the film unfold with a certain style and grace  revealing more about each character and what's going on.  the pacing is incredible  as is the direction - sergio leone manages to build a lot of uncomfortable tension in the film  keeping the film from ever getting predictable.  any typical western cliché that you can possibly think of is either given a unique twist or utterly destroyed by leone's masterful storytelling.  of special mention is ennio morricone's score  which is absolutely perfect.  two scenes - one in a union prison camp  one in the climatic gunfight in the cemetery at the end of the film - are amazing on their own  but they become absolutely astonishing with combined with morricone's powerful score. this movie is absolutely brilliant.  if you haven't seen it yet  i strongly urge to do so.  immediately.  (and then  go watch `unforgiven' . . . in a way  i think that `unforgiven' is the sequel to `the good  the bad  and the ugly - it's the story of what eventually happened to the man with no name.) `the good  the bad  and the ugly' is easily one of the best westerns ever made.  a++
no one throw away their shot and please watch hamilton!
i mean  i was pretty high  but still.it definitely lived up to my hype.
the fellowship of the ring was a monumentally entertaining film  the return of the king was an amazing wrap-up to the epic of our times  but the most dramatic moment for me came at the end of the two towers. after 3 hours of sweeping vistas  excellent shakespearean acting  and otherworldly sights and sounds  we are treated to a scene that still sends chills down my back and rouses me like nothing since the final scene in rocky. a lone rider (we all know who)  set against the top of a hill  massing legions of horsemen behind him. he appears just as the heroes are losing all hope. once he begins his descent down the hill with his army behind him  the camera begins a slow pan over the top and down with them  showing the size and scale of their forces. the evil army below looks up with surprise  a bright light fills the screen  the camera focuses on the lead rider (again  we all know who) who lets out a wrenching battle cry  the music swells to unbelievable heights  and i am swept away like i've never been before.this is cinema at its very best.
"peter jackson truly outdid himself when creating the lord of the rings: the fellowship of the ring and he fails to disappoint us in the 2nd part of the trilogy. the two towers shows us that he is not a one-hit wonder  like so many directors are. i actually think that the two towers reaches the same level as the fellowship of the ring  and sometimes even surpasses it.this film is the biggest film in the trilogy. what do i mean by that? well this film has so many things going like the amazing battle of helms deep. frodo and sam journey to mount doom  to destroy the ring. but the one who's leading them through the way is gollum  he looks so creepy and realistic  that he doesn't feel disconnected from us. a powerful performance by andy serkis as gollum  he should of been nominated for an oscar for best supporting actor.the best part of the film  is quite easily and everyone knows it the ending. the ending of the battle of helm's deep is quite breathtaking  and as gandalf the white comes in the distance with another army to defeat the orcs. when treebeard and his army of entz tear down isengard  the destruction and the battle is so immense in size  that you truly have to see to believe.in size and scale  peter jackson has truly redefined the word ""epic"" and he also pays attention to the small things that truly elevate this movie from great to amazing. i definitely recommend this film to everyone  but you really should watch the first movie to truly understand what's going on.10/10"
the matrix is one of the best science fiction action film directed by the wachowski brothers. the film has influenced both the cinema industry and the computer entertainment industry. when you watch the matrix for the first time  it looks like perfect action movie with high-class special effects and good actors.time passed and we remember only a black cloak  two hands shooting  kung-fu and running on the walls.recently i watched it again and i was amazed that there was so much hidden behind the spectacular scenes that i needed to watch this film several times  and i would probably find something that i had missed earlier. reality is the only what we see and feel.we can understand the movie in different ways. you will see what you emphasize. slavery  the fight against the system  the role of man in this system and the system in life  fanaticism and faith  chosenness and resurrection.i suggest watching the matrix even if you've already watched it.
the story of a reluctant christ-like protagonist set against a baroque  mtv backdrop  the matrix is the definitive hybrid of technical wizardry and contextual excellence that should be the benchmark for all sci-fi films to come.hollywood has had some problems combining form and matter in the sci-fi genre.  there have been a lot of visually stunning works but nobody cared about the hero. (or nobody simply cared about anything.)  there a few  though  which aroused interest and intellect but nobody 'ooh'-ed or 'aah'-ed at the special effects.  with the matrix  both elements are perfectly en sync.  not only did we want to cheer on the heroes to victory  we wanted them to bludgeon the opposition.  not only did we sit in awe as neo evaded those bullets in limbo-rock fashion  we salivated.but what makes the matrix several cuts above the rest of the films in its genre is that there are simply no loopholes.  the script  written by the wachowski brothers is intelligent but carefully not geeky.  the kung-fu sequences were deftly shot -- something even bruce lee would've been proud of.  the photography was breathtaking.  (i bet if you had to cut every frame on the reel and had it developed and printed  every single frame would stand on its own.)  and the acting?  maybe not the best keanu reeves but name me an actor who has box-office appeal but could portray the uneasy and vulnerable protagonist  neo  to a t the way reeves did.  but  come to think of it  if you pit any actor beside laurence fishburne  you're bound to confuse that actor for bad acting.  as morpheus  mr. fishburne is simply wicked!  shades of his mentor-role in higher learning  nobody exudes that aura of quiet intensity than mr. fishburne.  his character  battle-scarred but always composed morpheus  is given an extra dose of mortality (he loves neo to a fault.) only mr. fishburne can flesh out.people will say what they want to say about how good the matrix is but the bottomline is this: finally there's a philosophical film that has cut through this generation.  my generation. the wachowski brothers probably scribbled a little p.s. note when they finished the script saying: think for a moment about your existence.  what is the matrix  you ask?  something that's closer to reality than you think.either that or it's my personal choice for best film of all-time.
"'goodfellas' is a masterpiece  pure and simple. while not my favourite martin scorsese movie it is a stunning achievement  and one of his very best movies. the film is stunning technically. the consistently fine acting by the large ensemble cast (both known and unknown)  the cinematography  editing  dialogue  brilliant use of music  it's all breathtaking. but scorsese and co-writer mitch pileggi never lose lose sight of their main goal - to tell a story. and in that it's really hard to beat this movie. as to the actors de niro is on top form  ray liotta is the best he's ever been  and this is joe pesci's definitive performance. plus you have lorraine bracco  paul sorvino  michael imperioli  and lots of well known faces in small but important roles (debi mazar  samuel l. jackson  illeana douglas  kevin corrigan)  plus dozens of unfamiliar actors (and non-actors) who are all so good it seems unfair just to single out the ""stars"". (also keep an eye out for vincent gallo in a few scenes. he has no lines  but looks cool!). 'goodfellas' is (to date) scorsese's last great movie  and one of the very best films of the 1990s. absolutely essential viewing for any movie fan  this tremendous film is not to be missed! highly recommended!"
needs to be seen to be believed; in one word: perfection. every frame  every voice-over  every song - it all comes together at the exact right moment to create the perfect film experience. this film makes you really understand and feel what makes the american mafia so compelling; in the eyes of a kid  who was unfortunate enough to grow up in a tough neighborhood  those gangsters are rock stars. live fast  die young - but when you die  it ain't gonna be of a glamorous suicide or drug overdose - the ending will be brutal  ugly and sad. and it may very well be one of your best friends that will blow your brains out.i'll never get tired of watching goodfellas; the entertainment value of this film is just amazing. it doesn't happen very often that every person involved in the process of making a film is at the peak of his/her game. and rarely do art and entertainment come together the way they did here. storytelling with impeccable pacing  this is what it's like when a master composer conducts his masterpiece. all hail the king; the most versatile and talented filmmaker of his generation: martin scorsese.my vote: 10 out of 10favorite films: imdb.com/list/mkjokvqlsbs/lesser-known masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/favorite low-budget and b-movies: imdb.com/list/ls054808375/favorite tv-shows reviewed: imdb.com/list/ls075552387/
`it avoids having the standard shoot-'em-up ending ' says a friend of mine  `by not having an ending.'  i suppose this is what most people think  but all the same the film manages to form a satisfying whole; or at least  a whole that satisfies me.  i'm therefore inclined to think it does have an ending.  obviously  i can't discuss this without giving things away to those few who don't know what happens.  if you're one of those few  then believe me: your ignorance is precious enough to be worth guarding until you see the film.  stop reading now.after the surprise attack on the rebel base  luke skywalker splits with han  leia  et al.  han's party gets away first (is it just me  or is the shot of luke watching the falcon flying off while he stands stranded on the ground  a poignant one?)  but thereafter they face one narrow escape after another  while luke slinks off quietly and safely to train with yoda.the training scenes are many and yoda talks a great deal of rubbish.  but somehow it doesn't matter.  the film is ambivalent in its attitude towards yoda  anyway.  our sympathy clearly lies with the entirely non-spiritual concerns of han  leia and the adolescent luke.  the main story concerns the understanding that builds between han and leia.  in the end they are honest with one another; and if han's being frozen and shipped back to tatooine is the price to pay for this  well  it's the price to pay.  it was very important not to end with the dashing rescue that opens `return of the jedi'  which would be dramatically beside the point.  instead we end with the promise that the rescue will some day occur.  that's enough.as for luke: he abandons yoda to rescue han and leia  and achieves nothing whatever.  this was my favourite touch.  all five jedis - luke  obi-wan  yoda  vader  and the emperor - find that their conflicting instincts are all entirely wrong.  the film is really about the temporary triumph of human impulses over the mystical force.  luke's human idealism is vindicated  but his supernatural powers  just this once  are not.when george lucas gave his star wars trilogy a fresh coat of varnish in 1997 he felt he had to justify the expense by making needless changes.  you'll notice he made precious few changes to episode v.  there just wasn't room. he added a few extra shots of the ice monster  which of course weakened that one scene; but even with those changes in place the special edition is virtually identical to the original edition.  since lucas was so keen on making changes wherever he could this is obviously a tribute to the tightness of the story and the direction.  it's also a tribute to the perfection of the original special effects  more innovative than the effects in the first star wars movie and better than the effects in any subsequent one.
star wars: episode v - the empire strikes back (1980) is an excellent timeless classic that it is the best sequel of all time. i love this film to death  it is my second favorite film and the best sequel in the star wars franchise that i love. the empire strikes back is a movie that it is one of the best sequels i can think of  it is right there with aliens (1986)  it is right there with terminator 2: judgment day (1991) it is an excellent sequel and it really does establish the empire as a value treat. empire strikes back is still and excellent film which i really believe is a timeless classic. this is my second favorite film from director irvin kershner. number 1 favorite irvin kershner film will be robocop 2 (1990) which is very underrated action flick. i still have to review those movies someday.empire strikes back (1980) is the best one of the series  because it's deeper  darker  more philosophical. it's great because darth vader and the empire are at their most menacing  the direction is creative  the characters feel real  the nature of the force is explored more without losing its mysticism  and the pacing is  as george lucas would put it  faster and more intense than any other film in the saga.the plot is actually more a rescue mission that luke skywalker (mark hamill) is coming to rescue his friends han solo  princess leia organa  c-3po and chewbacca are captured on a planet bespin in cloud city from villainous darth vader. han solo's friend lando calrissian (billy dee williams) set the up and with darth vader he set a trap for luke. also luke studied the force under jedi master yoda to become a full jedi knight but in the end he must confront darth vader (david prowse) by him self. the origins of luke skywalker are reveled.empire strikes back was released in 1980 it is directed by irvin kershner this time and not george lucas. because george lucas decide that he want to make this sequel independent one  so he ended up coming with his own  founding for the film. getting a loan and money he earn from the first movie and it success  so he decided he wanted  to found the film him self  and he wanted to be more an executive producer to keep an eye on the lamp  he moved to a bigger studio in orange county  california  so he diced to be more a producer he did not want to direct empire strikes back. so his first choice was irvin kershner  who was a professor at uc in the uc film school  that george attended too and he always liked irvin kershner and of course he was a former professor and it was a hard way talk him to do it and the first time irvin kershner didn't want to do it  so george called irvin's agent and his agent said to irvin take it so he did and the rest is a history. this stands the test of time  the best film he ever directed! i love john williams score still the same  but i think john williams changed the music score for a little bit  but that's just my opinion.things that i love in this film: i love the battle with rebels fighting with the imperial at-at walkers on the ice world of hoth. that is my favorite scene on ice world in the film. the imperial at-at walkers are incredible well made with classic special effects.i love that the origins of luke skywalker are reveled  that luke is the son of darth vader  who is actually anakin skywalker  before he become darth vader and went to the dark site.for the first time ever  we see an emperor in a hologram talking to darth vader.the falcon with han solo  princess leia organa  c-3po and chewbacca hiding in the rocks try's to eat a monster.luke faces with darth vader him self face to face and get his arm cut off and then he jumps off the bridge  because he didn't want to join his father in a dark force. the lightsaber duel throughout the chamber between luke and darth vader was excellent and it was epic.the training sequence with luke and master yoda were excellent and epic. a new hope and the empire strikes back are my favorite films in series  that are in the franchise  this film get's a perfect 10 score for been the best sci-fi adventure sequel of all time.
"this is undeniably one of the best films ever made in the history of movie making.. in 1975  ""one flew over the cuckoo's nest"" swept all four major academy awards... best actor (jack nicholson) best actress (louise fletcher) best direstor (milos foreman) and  of course  best picture!! only on very rare occasion does this occur... only a handful of films may lay claim to such an honor!! ""one flew over the cuckoo's nest"" is a stunning portrayal of mental illness  and how even the most affluent nation on earth (the u.s.a.) is totally unequipped to deal with it properly!! jack nicholson's performance in this movie is one of the greatest performances ever by an actor... the array of all the psychologically debilitating diseases was itemized to a flawless state of depressing realism.. the emotional explanations for the dysfunctional dispositions with everyone in ""one flew over the cuckoo's nest"" were so astutely broken down that it evoked a concise indication that not just any producers  directors  actors or actresses could partake in this film!! such a depiction upholds the proverbial contention that if you are not mentally disturbed when you go into the ""booby hatch"" you will be when you get out of it!! in the case of jack nicholson's character  he seemed relatively non-culpable for any intense psychiatric affliction  it was a matter of slight discrepancies!! it is as if he was severely punished for not finishing his cereal at breakfast time!! the talent in this movie is incredible.. i liked the television show ""taxi"" and it stands to reason why... so many of the actors who starred in ""one flew over the cuckoo's nest"" were in the t.v. show ""taxi"" too!! the gripping conversation which dealt with a man who was impotent was perhaps the single most poignant part of this film!! the line i remember in particular was ""do me a favor and don't be on my side  okay""... in the ""normal"" world  the average person is burdened in his ability to communicate with someone else due to a conflict of interests!! in the case of a poorly funded mental health facility  this apocalyptic predicament manifests itself horrendously  and thus has an intolerable proliferation!! authorities in the mental hospital are restricted by a serious lack of funding  so they are quick to generalize!! the overall situation which garners societal sympathy at a mental health facility is categorized as ""sad"" and platitudes such as ""we will do all we can"" are everybody's precarious form of consolation!!! mental illness gets a generic label  and  from there  becomes something which is basically swept under the rug!! here is where the film ""one flew over the cuckoo's nest"" expounds on their abysmal dissertation concerning mental illness!!""one flew over the cuckoo's nest"" was based on a true story!! mr mcmurphy (jack nicholson) was a lone rebel from start to finish with this film!! whatever the orderlies or the nurses would say  he would disagree with!! it was always an issue that could not be looked at rationally by one patient or the other that compounded the dilemma of mental anguish... such a plight became the culprit to a lack of thorough communication  and thus invoked an overreaction from the administration of the hospital!! you are branded mentally ill and that is all anyone has to know!! the total lack of egalitarian commiseration with administration was why mcmurphy was so belligerent!! the status quo was to subject patients to grave consequences for their actions... are the nurses and administrators wrong for doing this? usually not!! it was the gray matter in this film that made it so intellectually riveting!! mental health patients are often times aware of the fact that they are vilified in the same manner you would a bunch of seven year old kids for not doing their school work!! their self respect gets relegated to a bureaucratic mandate  and all of this is subconsciously and consciously demoralizing!! if someone were to have a conversation with charles manson  they would realize so many depraved patterns of illogical behavior to him  however  if charles manson were to say that two plus two equals four  the correct answer does not get changed to five!! what is the point of this example? mental health patients are not inaccurate in every assessment that they make  just because they are labeled mentally challenged!! what was mr mcmurphy's contention with so many issues is that he would assume a premise of mutual self respect when engaging in an argument with an orderly... this is not a case of defiance  rather an instance of a one on one debate... how quickly the administration would then resort to the cop out of ""well!!"" ""what do you expect!!"" ""this guy is mentally ill""i have never seen a film like this one!! ""woman under the influence"" which was made around the same time was incredibly spellbinding as well... ""one flew over the cuckoo's nest"" however  is something which should be put in a category all by itself!! director  milos foreman articulates cerebral despondence to a state of dissonant plausibility with this film!! this becomes an avenue for political debate... foreman's movie breaks ground on mental illness being one big cacophony of our nation's failure to communicate!! louise fletcher is tremendous as nurse ratched  her dedication to the tenets of disciplinary policy became vicariously ruthless  her devotion to this standard was extremely deep rooted!! nurse ratched's insolence was an aspect of infuriation that was in of itself amazingly thought provoking!! as i have previously mentioned  jack nicholson was excellent as mcmurphy  the mental health patient who reoriented the ideology of what it means to deal with mental illness... tremendous film  maybe the best american film ever made... do you think that sounds strong? watch the movie first and then tell me i am exaggerating!! remarkable!! utterly remarkable!!"
"i went into this film with the knowledge that it had been the second film in history to win the 'top five' oscars (for best picture  best actor  best actress  best director and best screenplay) and has been praised as ""one of jack nicholson's finest roles"" and ""one of the classics of the 70's"". naturally  after hearing all this  i had high expectations for one flew over the cuckoo's nest. but nonetheless  i was surprised at how easily the film surpassed my expectations and easily led me to understand how it merited all that praise.based on the novel by ken kesey  the story follows randle patrick mcmurphy (jack nicholson)  who  in an attempt to get out of spending more time in prison  pleads insanity for his crime  and is therefore sentenced to time in a mental institution. this was mcmurphy's intention  as he believes the conditions in a ""crazy house"" will be significantly easier to contend with than another harsh stay in prison. however  he quickly finds out that surviving the institution with it's desolate patients (including christopher lloyd  danny devito  vincent schiavelli and an absolutely brilliant brad dourif as the stuttering billy bibbit) and the monstrously repressive nurse ratchet (louise fletcher  in a career defining role) is considerably harder than he imagined. mcmurphy plays pranks  horseplay  and is generally defiant to the rules of the institution in an attempt to raise spirits. his constant optimism and reckless defiance to the out of date rules in the institution can be very uplifting  and often quite funny as well  but much of the movie can be very depressing - the generally decrepit state of the institution is a consistently (and intentionally) bleak background to a superb story with a truly bittersweet ending.jack nicholson is at his best here  head and shoulders above other excellent performances such as in 'chinatown' or 'as good as it gets'. mcmurphy is an apparently unquenchable optimist  refusing to succumb to the defeated spirit of all the other patients. his livewire antics  inspiring the patients are generally uplifting  and when his indomitable spirit is finally broken  we really feel for him and his fellow patients. nicholson conveys the essence of mcmurphy to perfection  demonstrating his excellent understanding and interpretation of the character. when mcmurphy announces that he is going to lift a huge stone fountain and hurl it through the window to escape  the other patients are so caught up in his intoxicating spirit of freedom that they honestly believe he can do it  despite the fact it would be impossible for a man much stronger than him. when mcmurphy finally discovers that despite his best efforts  he cannot lift the fountain  he is so openly crushed that we can't help but feel for him. beneath the frequent profanities and livewire antics  there are real human emotions  which come across as truly touching.what can be said about one flew over the cuckoo's nest which hasn't already been said? it has an excellent storyline  top notch acting  painfully bleak visuals  perfectly setting the tone for the movie  and alternates between being truly uplifting to devastatingly depressing. it features perhaps the most memorable film ending ever  next to a man on his horse riding off into the sunset  and leaves the viewer beaten down by the conflicting emotions  unaware what to think of the picture next to reveling in it's glorious entirety. it's hard to produce a final outcome any better than this.-10/10"
i watched this movie. it's a good movie but i couldn't understand how it won the best picture. i think this movie doesn't deserve that for sure.
"it's not really a review but my attempt to explain how i interpreted the movie to those who complain that the film is overrated  especially if the reason is that they didn't like the second half of it.it's much easier to understand the message of a movie when the 'good guys' win or the 'bad guys' get punished in the end. i'm not saying that all hollywood films are so naive in their portrayal of moral values. but still  i believe that parasite is much more subtle than most other movies that people are accustomed to watching in which there's a character with a clearer 'moral center' whom audiences can easily relate to. so  i think it's no surprise if the message of this film had failed to register for some of the audiences.some complained that they don't understand ki-taek's motive for killing mr. park. but to fully appreciate this  you need to understand the meaning of a recurring expression in the dialogue which is  ""crossing the line"".it's a deliberately ambiguous phrase that can either read as one should respect other people's privacy or as one should mind one's own (social) position instead of meddling with the affairs of those in a different position. if interpreted as the latter meaning  it can serve as another image that emphasizes the subject matter of the narrative  along with more easy to notice the metaphor of the two families' respective dwellings.it would probably have satisfied such audiences who expected more lighthearted drama if the movie focused on an underprivileged  but more likable family exploiting a cold hearted snobbish family in a comical manner. but the movie would have lost all its genuine charms if bong joon-ho chose such a path  and he is too good a director not to see such a danger.instead  he chose to make mr. park a reasonable enough character  despite his occasional hints that reveal his true nature. he seems to treat ki-taek fairly enough at first  but he also warns the latter not to 'cross the line' if ki-taek attempts to pry into his private life.at first  it seems that it's quite easy for ki-taek and other members of his family to sneak into mr. park's house in various roles and mingle with them. ki-taek even compliments how nice mr. park's family is  but his premature admiration soon gets challenged when he overheard  when he was hiding under the table  what mr. park really thinks of him - almost a different species of the human being who doesn't even smell like him.ki-taek's final disillusionment came when mr. park cringes from the smell of the dead basement dweller and shows much more concern for his son's shock while virtually ignoring ki-taek's daughter's status who's dying on the ground  spurting blood from the stab wound.that moment  ki-taek realizes how mr. park sees him and his whole family as not an equal human being  but something much more insignificant.and he also realizes the 'line' that separates the two families is not just that of courtesy or proper social behaviour. instead  it is a line that can even determine the life of those 'lesser' human beings to be less important than the passing unpleasant feelings or mental shock of those 'proper' human beings.however easy it was for ki-taek's family to sneak into mr. park's house  or however they try to socialize and mingle with mr. park's family  their existence is no better than that of a 'parasite'  which is also visualized so effectively by the presence of the hidden basement room inside the house.with such disillusionment and anger  ki-taek chose to kill mr. park  as a parasite could to its host  and like a parasite  he keeps hiding deep inside the dead host's body until he could claim the whole of the carcass and use it as nourishment for his offsprings.the tragedy was not something caused by any exceptional defect or vice of either mr. park's or ki-taek's personalities. instead  it's a 'line' drawn by an invisible hand  separating those classes according to their respective social conditions  which can be so brutal as to be able to deprive the two families of their humanity in contrasting manners. and that is what i believe to be the message this film is trying to convey.of course  not every movie must make a commentary on society rather than providing a care-free pastime that everyone can understand.but without if the movie didn't change its gear in the second half to shed light on a serious inherent problem of our society  it would be just another heist gone wrong type comedy  instead of a deserving candidate to be called the best film of the year."
i was extremely lucky to get the chance to see this film upon its first day release  before entering the cinema  my expectations were already high  after all  this was a film from the cinematic genius who brought us the likes of 'inception' and 'the dark knight'  to summarise the following review in a single sentence: i left the cinema in extreme awe from the visual masterpiece i had just viewed. a film that explores the psychological and emotional state of a man whose life revolves around his family  'interstellar' is a thrilling and thought-provoking film that boasts an intellectual story masterfully written by the nolan brothers. whilst there seems to have been influence from films like '2001: a space odyssey' and 'apollo 13'  'interstellar' is unique in its own way. whilst the subject may be hard to comprehend at times  it can't be denied how visually monumental and thoughtful christopher nolan's epic science fiction masterpiece is  and can easily be named the best film of this year and possibly one of the greatest science fiction films to have ever graced the screen. a sheer brilliant feat of cinema.
"the best movie i ever saw and i watched hundreds off them from godfather  pulp fiction  the green mile  the pianist  schindler's list  rear window  the shining  alien etc. what can you ask more: space exploration  apocalyptic earth  emotions  tears  time manipulation  amazing visuals  maybe the best music score  touching acting  everything you want. shame on all the oscar ""experts""!"
"'what are you doing  you're just a kid?' ""i steal  i kill  i carry a gun  how can i be just a kid? i am a man.""many who visit brazil the first time  tend to view brazilians as lacking serious ambition. they seem to party the night away  and appear to seldom work. the old joke about brazilians is that they have breakfast at 2:00 in the afternoon.but such a narrow view does not take into account the fact that while we in america work to live  sweating away for pennies which the government steals at every turn  they in brazil live to live. it is a different kind of living  a life that sambas with the vibrance of the swaying palm and the bounding drum. a life that understands that we are only on this earth for a cup of cafezinho  and we should have fun while we can before the end comes  but quick.but as the city of god also shows us  brazilian life is often nasty  brutish and short. a certain degree of anarchy overshadows all the denizens of the film. but director fernando meirelles takes a situation lacking definite boundaries and clear authority  and creates a framework  a structure  that of gang rule. the gang-members are not seasoned  old-time criminals like fredo corleone or even tony montana. instead  they are a bunch of sweet-faced kids. no one is older than 25  partly because of choice  but mainly because no one lives past this age.on the surface  in this context  city of god is a coming of age story of two young people  a sort of brazilian ""angels with dirty faces.' one character escapes from the city of god  while the other succumbs to it.but when one scratches beneath  one finds the film a comment on the morally bankrupt city of god in rio de janeiro  and a mirror on brazil itself. far away from the party hopping  travel and leisure postcard perfect white beaches  is another world  one of marauding bands of displaced children.the most surprising thing about city of god is its references to american films. most brazilian films  as the films of all countries do  owe allegiance to their own particular cultural situation. brazil owes a cultural debt to europe (portugal  germany  italy) and africa. however  the united states has a far more distant cultural relationship to brazil. that is where city of god triumphs to me an american film goer. it uses the chapter format made famous in pulp fiction and more recently  kill bill. it uses the familial structure present in goodfellas. it uses the 'white-suit cool' present in miami vice and the bacardi and cola ads from the preview before this very movie.the fact that city of god can be subtitled grand theft auto: sao paolo  is not a surprise nor a mistake. the film is built like a video game in its use of random acts of violence. but the fluid perfect camera work and editing give way to a film with enormous contradictions. contradictions as large and as vast as the noble country itself.stylistically  the camera work does not conform to its premise as a gangster film. a gangster film never looked this good. it is as if the camera is released in the wide open beaches  and kicked around like one of ronaldinho's headers. it starts on the sand and moves steadily across. it picks up on the story but then heads into the sun. it then leaves us  the film-viewer  with the most indelible image in years as we see sonia braga (a world icon and sex symbol of brazil)'s niece  sitting on the sun-drenched coast putting her arm around another young boy. the innocence conveyed in this scene is something to behold. it literally takes your breath away.you see the slamming of different  competing themes. you see the subtlety and tranquility of the beach  smashed into scenes of battered youths dying on city streets. you see a wealth of hypnotic ambiguous images pulled together  much like the very culture of brazil itself."
"cidade de deus seems to have a lot of praise on the imdb boards  and with good reason too. it simply is  in my opinion  one of the best contemporary films ever made.based on true events and characters who live in the overlooked and poverty stricken slums in the shadows of rio de janiero  where life expectancy doesn't reach the 30's and drug dealers are kings.the tale of the city of god  and its myriad of characters is told by rocket  a young man who struggles to make something of his life  other than to wind up another victim of drugs or gang wars.not only are the characters in city of god absolutely fascinating  and also very endearing  but also convincingly acted by groups of young and unknown actors. the stoies are well-told  and at times  funny  and at others  brutally shocking.the cinematic style of the film gives a nod to tarantino  with some clever time-jumping  freeze-framing  and texts indicating another chapter of the film. in every sense  a bit of a brazillian ""pulp fiction"" or ""goodfellas""  but with its own unique flavour to it.the city of god is a marvel  and a highly recommended film to watch  but not recommended for the over-sensitive or easily distressed."
"this movie is an outstanding piece of artwork. i hadn't heard much about it when it was first released. being a huge oscar fan  i was surprised when it took home the award for best animated film. at that point  knew nothing about it.after reading a little more and seeing some commercials  i still wasn't sure whether or not i wanted to see this film. it looked so surreal in an ""alice in wonderland"" sort of way. i had never been a big fan of that film and didn't really want to relive such an idea. mindbending films have never been my absolute favorites.i went to see ""spirited away"" with a friend who was into anime. he hadn't heard much about it either  but was interested in seeing it in the theater. since it had won the academy award  i decided it was a good idea to give it a shot.i am so glad i did. only a very few times in my life have a i seen a movie as brilliant as this. it stands alone with such masterpieces like ""citizen kane "" ""vertigo "" ""the godfather"" and any other classic piece of cinema in history.i won't go into too much detail  but i was spellbound from the opening credits until the closing ones. the story starts out so rough and scary  but becomes a work of happiness and beauty. to think that this movie almost didn't get made is a travesty. it will stand the test of time and go out as one of the greatest films ever made."
"personally  i've never seen anything as original in an animated film as in this deeply mythical fairytale. what a surreal idea for a movie! it's hard to find an adequate description (because i also don't want to spoil this in the slightest way) but this film has a sense of ""otherness"" to it - for lack of a better word - like none i've ever seen. and the strange  mythical nature of this film - apart from the amazing artwork - is probably one of the main reasons for its appeal to me. maybe the themes of the story don't feel quite as strange to an eastern audience because they fit to a certain degree with some eastern/asian mythologies - to me  this beautiful piece of wonder was something new. and a profoundly moving experience. outstanding animation; funny  weird  scary and touching at the same time  this unique work of art is one i can't recommend enough. 10 out of 10.favorite films: http://www.imdb.com/list/mkjokvqlsbs/lesser-known masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/favorite tv-shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/favorite low-budget and b-movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/"
saving private ryan is a top wwii film and i've seen it a dozen times. as the film starts we are presented with a hundred or so ships coming across the sea. suddenly violence erupts and soldiers are slaughtered on the d-day assualt. in the assualt  captain miller (tom hanks) leads his platoon up and around the german lines for a flank attack. across the ocean  a mother receives three kia letters in the same day but is promised that her youngest son  private ryan (matt damon) will be found in france and sent home. on the normandy beach  captain miller and his platoon will be sent on a suicide mission across france to find private ryan and battle across the german lines. through the whole mission the soldiers are pushed to the limit with the death of comrades and questioning of the mission.steven spielberg works his magic again with the presentation of one of the most honored war movies in film history. tom hanks is strong  smart and above all good as captain miller. there is also a surprise with one of vin diesel's first roles as private caparzo. the violence is brutal  bloody  and well crafted. each character is interesting and their fears and weaknesses are each expressed in the film.saving private ryan. starring: tom hanks  tom sizemore  edwards burns  barry pepper  vin diesel  and matt damon.4 1/2 out of 5 stars
"my grandfather fought in ww2 somehow surviving d-day. he was apart of operation neptune and stormed the beaches of normandy. he told us a lot of war stories but rarely ever spoke about that day. before he passed away he did an interview with a local newspaper and detailed what he saw despite it being very difficult for him to speak about. he loved watching war movies... not sure exactly why. some about that soldier life never really leaves them i guess. he absolutely hated pearl harbor cause of the horrible way they portray the military to be a bunch of toothbrush wielding babies who don't know what to do in the event of being attacked. he had a friend stationed there who lost his life and thinks that movie is a disgusting display of ignorance. soldiers don't take girlfriends on private plane rides. and they most definitely know how to swim. maybe i'll give that movie a good ripping one day.but saving private ryan was a respectable ""i can't watch this"" reaction. he said no movie has come that close to capturing what that day was like. he said it was too realistic. whether or not the story is based on real or fiction  that intro was 100% realistic. i'm not sure if he ever did finish watching it but he appreciated it for capturing that chaos like no other movie has before. i watched the movie a dozen times now and keep it in my collection as a reminder of my grandfather. a scene he was technically in. which makes me appreciate how strong of a person he really is.war is hell and this movie not only shows that while being an entertaining experience but also captured what soldiers are left behind with. my grandfather was not afraid of anything. i've seen this man walk into a cellar full of black widows to get firewood and not even shake them off. the only time he ever experienced fear was when he went to bed. his nightmares of his time during the war would haunt him in his sleep. this movie helped me understand why."
"the shawshank redemption is possibly my favorite movie ever. i had seen many movies before it  and i've certainly seen a lot after  but not many of them made me feel what that one did. now  i have that feeling again. and once again  it comes from watching a frank darabont movie. i couldn't possibly explain the overload of emotions i experienced in the 3 hours it lasts. i have laughed. i have felt the emotions of every character. and most of all  i have cried. very few movies have touched me like this one. is there something to say about the acting that hasn't been said before? no  it isn't. you may have heard it is flawless  incredible  whatever. you did hear right  it absolutely is. i can't think of anyone in the whole movie that wasn't convincing in the least. the script has its funny moments  but it's incredibly deep  poignant and heartfelt. the characters are so ""human"" and unpretentious you can't help but adore them. but  well  there will be some you'd like to strangle. there has to be a villain everywhere  right? the green mile is a movie i will hardly forget. you can't possibly forget such an emotive story.what  you want to watch it? great! but don't forget to have grab some tissues first."
i expected this movie to be a normal and i just want to see it for tom hanks but as movie goes through i cry i laugh and there comes a feeling which can't be described in words. i rate this movie as the best i have ever seen. some moments in the movie makes me hold my bed pillow in the tightest ever grip. i can guarantee that this movie will leave an impression in your mind for a long time. i even say that this movie is better than shawshank redemption.fantastic story  brilliant acting mind boggling feelings and overall an unforgettable drama. if you have watched 1000 movies and not this then your movie watching journey is incomplete.i will also make sure that even my next generation should watch this one.
i typically don't care much for sub-titled movies.  foreign films to me are slow and about nothing.  so i naturally went to see life is beautiful with a chip on my shoulder.  i wanted to hate it.  i wanted it to be just another movie that hollywood was praising to show that they were an intelligent bunch of people.  oh boy was i in for the surprise of my life.  not only is this film good  i honestly believe that it was the second best film of 98  next to saving private ryan.  the mere fact that shakespeare in love won best picture over not only ryan but over this  is a joke.  it's actually funny.benigni did everything in this film.  he wrote  produced  directed and probably swept the floors at night.  there is that much raw energy in this film.  there really is.  for someone to have that kind of vision is truly incredible.  and not only is the film a terrific cinematic experience because of the importance and seriousness of the subject matter  but it is one of the funnier films i've ever seen.  when roberto is translating the german soldiers insructions to his son so that he isn't scared  it is at that moment that you realize you are under his spell.  he's got you and no matter how much sceptisism you may have about the film you know you're witnessing a classic in every sense of the word.i loved this film.  loved everything about it and i am so glad that i got to see it and cheer benigni at the oscars.  he certainly deserved his best actor award and he should have gotten more.
"i am surprised about the negative comments that some people made on this web-page.  i can see how some people might not experience the same kind of uplift or joy that most of us lived through when seeing the movie.  but that some viewers felt insulted and betrayed because the movie did not depict ""reality"" as it really was or is  is not fair.i must concur with my fellow proponents of the movie -- it was a great and very satisfying movie.  it provided me with something that everyone in one or another shape or form needs -- hope.  the movie showed the cruelty of life and yet managed to shed some light and insight into the beauty of love and life in general.i urge anyone who has not seen la vita è bella to go out there and watch it. if we all take with us just little bit of that hope and love that this movie is trying to convey; this world would be a much better place.
thank you for reading this and i hope you enjoyed or will enjoy the movie as much as i did."
i would love to see another film like that. i have been searching everywhere and most of the films in this genre sucks or it's plain stupid.
"the movie  ""se7en""  starring brad pitt  morgan freeman  and gwyneth paltrow  is by far one of the most inventive  well-written  and cerebral films in recent history. the film  blending a well put together combination of dark visual style  intense plot development  and polished acting  remains tight and focused throughout  from beginning to end  never straying outwards into unimportant issues  or resorting to typical hollywood clichés. se7en is uniquely on its own for suspense dramas as it both fuels the need of the audience to be drawn in and entertained by the events unfolding  and remain uncompromising and shocking  thus satisfying the initial vision of the director  david fincher.the story surrounds the hunt for a serial killer  who  inspired by dante alighieri's seven deadly sins from ""the divine comedy""  sets out to  ""preach"" about man's impurity  and does so by targeting victims  then torturing them by pitting their own underlining sins against them. se7en seemingly starts out as a typical cat and mouse detective story  however  it quickly develops into of a sort of modern-myth  with good and evil taking centre stage. the story is original on all counts  and thrilling on all levels. the most important aspect of se7en  however  is that it keeps the audience numerous steps behind its story  as oppose to other thrillers  which become predictable and bland by the end. by keeping the audience in the dark  the film remains fresh and original as it progresses. se7en even dramatically turns the tide at one point  just as the audience is finally getting comfortable and asserted into the gloomy atmosphere  thus creating as much as fear and uncertainty in the audience as it is with the characters involved. by the film's conclusion  the audience is as much apart of the film as the characters themselves  and arrive at se7en's surprise ending without a single clue of it  prior to it occurring. se7en's poetic ending(which will not be given away) says a lot for the people behind the movie  showing they are not afraid of going against the grain. a rarity with films so nowadays.directed brilliantly by david fincher  and skillfully written by andrew kevin walker  se7en is well crafted and ingeniously clever  making it one of the greatest films of the 90's. while se7en may not have garnered critical acclaim as such films as silence of the lambs  se7en is  undoubtedly  as influential as any film to date.score 10/10"
silence of the lambs offers one of the most controversial and fascinating stories in the history of cinema. a picture that for the entire duration is a mixture of comedy / theatrical tragedy and a cult film (which it later became). we witness the whole story  frame to frame  step by step from a glorious balcony of a theatre stage made of wood and blood  with spotlights focused on some of the greatest actors in history and of that time. unprecedented direction  incessant rhythm that keeps glued to the armchair  almost as if dr. hannibal had chained us all himself.
"sweeping all five major academy awards (""oscars"" for best movie  director  actor  actress  screenplay) is quite an accomplishment.  doing it nearly a year after a film was released is a miracle considering the notoriously short attention span of oscar voters.  it is a powerful example of how great a movie can be when superb writers  directors  actors  and others work at the top of their craft.`silence of the lambs' is  the story of a young fbi trainee clarice starling (jodie foster) who is summoned to help find one serial killer called `buffalo bill.' by interviewing another.  foster's performance is absolutely brilliant.  while anthony hopkins receives most of the (well-deserved) praise for his chilling portrayal of incarcerated serial killer `hannibal the cannibal' lector'  it is foster's performance that holds the movie together.  the fear she shows just behind her eyes makes clarice's outward courage all the more interesting and vulnerable.  this is the perfect way to play the part because it explains lector's interest in clarice.  her only bargaining chip in getting lector's help is to let him `feed' on her innermost secrets and fears in exchange for his brilliant insights into the psychotic mind.  the title of the movie comes from these exchanges and is very poignant.director jonathan demme is masterful.  there is one scene late in the movie that i will not spoil.  it is one of the most simply brilliant scenes ever staged in a movie.  i don't know if all the credit goes to demme or the writers  but there is a moment in the film where the suspense builds beautifully to a what seems to be a common movie scene.  however  through skillful timing of the direction  the audiences assumptions are used against them and when the truth is revealed (hint: it involves a doorbell) it is shocking and induced a collective gasp from the audience i saw it with at the theatre.  it set the stage for an edge-of-your seat climax.do not miss this movie.the movie is incredibly suspenseful and an absolute must see."
in respect to the many kids of the seventies. i rated this movie as one of the greatest movies ever made. i was thirteen and enjoyed this fantasy getaway more than i could count. like many other kids of the seventies you left reality before walking into the theatre and escaped into the adventure once the reels begin rolling. it provided the special effects and excitement a kid was looking for. even today when i watch this movie on vhs i recall those times. whenever i get the chance to watch it i feel like that eager thirteen year old over and over again. i hope the new movies will meet the same expectations of kids of  this decade and the next.
"""a long time ago  in a galaxy far  far away...""pre review:it's writing started in january 1973  ""eight hours a day  five days a week""  george lucas said by taking small notes  inventing odd names and assigning them possible characterization... after many drafts  he finally came to a satisfactory conclusion.then  lucas presented star wars to the united artists  but they refused to budget the film  so he went to universal pictures  the studio that financed american graffiti; however  it was rejected  as the film concept was ""too strange"".suddenly  alan ladd jr -head of 20th century fox- appeared  a man that trusted in lucas genius. and that's how star wars became a reality.the shooting of the movie was full of mishaps  problems with practical effects never done before  a bad first edit of the movie  but that didn't stop george from fulfilling his space opera. due to those setbacks  fox studios began to put pressure on lucas to finish the movie. finally  the movie was done. on the eve of star wars release  20th century fox  george lucas and his cast and crew braced themselves for the worse. one way or another  may 25  1977 would be a day they would never forget...review:star wars is a modern tale of mythic adventure. it follows the journey and growth of the protagonist: luke skywalker. his journey of discovery is set amidst a larger struggle between the empire and the rebel alliance; both parties are embroiled in a civil war. the empire is comprised of corrupted power within a small group of leaders. these sullied leaders abuse their power over the masses with impunity. it is oppression and repression of the masses. the empire wants to destroy the hope of the rebellion to ensure the small group of leaders can keep their power...one of the most important features of the movie are the special effects. the use motion control was even superior to stanley kubrick's revolutionary masterpiece: ""2001: a space odyssey"" thanks to the creation of the dykstraflex  the first digital motion control photography camera system developed for star wars on 1976. along with an incredibly iconographic character and production design  the movie became stylistically unique.the story and the characters are original and relatable. r2-d2 and c-3po: the astromech as the optimistic adventurer's desiring to move forward. in direct opposition c-3po  the protocol droid filled with doubt and reservations. luke skywalker  the brave hero  often haunted by doubts and hopes about his future journey. obi-wan kenobi  the wise master and moral guidance of our hero. han solo  the rebellious smuggler whose personality represents tenacity. leia  the damsel ""in distress""  a fearsome princess and general. finally  darth vader  the most iconic character in the franchise  the merciless tyrant in a black suit  representing evil and final conflict of the journey.the film score presents an emotional resonance trough a romantic 1930s hollywood orchestral score that was commissioned for composer john williams  who succeeded to create a haunting constellation of operatic leitmotifs.the visual composition is authentic  as lucas wanted a nostalgic ""filtered look"" so he kept changing key lights for a ""flashing"" effect. he used a loose  ""nervous"" frame  as in newsreels. the dramatic center was displaced  deflecting the eye to background activity  which in later films would include poetically changing weather. this first film gradually turned darker  following a symbolic color scheme where organic brown and warm gold yielded to high-tech black  white  and steely gray."" this is authenticity is reflected in it's most iconic shot: the 'binary sunset' sequence  which establishes the narrative through-line of the story and the world it takes place in  the main value of the scene lies in how powerfully and economically it develops luke's character: as the suns begin to slowly sink in the evening sky  he gazes towards the horizon  his sense of longing for something more is palpable. taking things further  he goes on to squint into the distance as if he could see his new future just out of reach  and for the first time we get to see him not as a kid  but for as a new hope.books such as ""the hero with a thousand faces"" by joseph campbell structured the story  the war of vietnam inspired the battle between the rebels and the empire  the lifestyle of buddhist monks characterized the jedi  real shots of warplanes made the space battles real  kendo foreshadowed the epic lightsaber duel  akira kurosawa's storytelling influenced the focus on minor characters  fritz lang's it's iconic protocol droid and john ford westerns determined it's soul.the fascination with filmmaking and anthropology are the components that allowed star wars to be compelling and human  besides being located on a galaxy far  far away.10/10"
"masaki kobayashi studied art and philosophy before starting as assistant director at shochiku studio. his oeuvre is guided by the need to understand the human condition. in the 1962 hara-kiri aka seppuku  we can clearly see the philosophic influence in this story about confrontation between human condition and rigid code of a feudal society. the result of this confrontation is a multi layered masterpiece in which the clarity of the script  the perfection of the interpretation  and a very well balanced ""mise en scène"" make for a powerful film based on transgression: a genre transgression  a code transgression and an image transgression. most of shambaras take place during the edo period but rather late in that period (just before the meiji era) as most filmmakers try to romanticize and glamorize the period which marks the end of the samurai thus playing the nostalgia card. here masaki kobayashi transgressed the genre and decided to film a story taking place in 1630  17th century japan during the edo period. at that time japan was ruled by a shogunate (ieyasu tokugawa). the tokugawa shoguns established peace and continued to rule japan for a remarkable 250 years. but such a long period of peace had a price and ieyasu tokugawa brought the whole country under tight control. he cleverly redistributed the land among the more loyal vassals  breaking up warrior clans thus throwing thousands of samurai into poverty. in the film an elder ronin  hanshiro tsugumo  the hypnotic tatsuya nakadai (goyokin) seeks admittance to the house of a feudal lord to commit the act of seppuku as he can no longer stand his life of dishonor and poverty. there  the administrator tells him about the fate of a young samurai who committed the same suicidal ritual few times ago. but there is much more to this story and soon we understand that all protagonists are related one way or another. as the film progresses we witness a confrontation between two conceptions. one is based on a human code; the other is based on a rigid traditional one. masaki kobayashi uses both symbols and raw images to show this confrontation. the film starts with the display of a samurai shining battle armor representing the feudal system. the armor is empty of anything human and strongly symbolized the feudal system. can a code make sense if it is followed without acknowledging the human condition? this is in essence the question raised by ""hara-kiri"". we see this armor soiled and dragged but at the end of the film the armor remains intact as if nothing had ever happened  as if changes in an given society take some times to occur. indeed social progress has always been slow leaving men and women struggling with their condition. the suicidal ritual  hara-kiri reinforced the sense of cruelty. raw images of ronin opening their stomach with a sword were a transgression at that time (1962)  still is today. in the film the ritual is portrayed in a non glamorized way and very realistically. it also symbolizes even for the japanese audience the lack of sense in the act of seppuku. in fact hanshiro tsugumo is the only one giving meaning to this act by motivating it with mixed feelings of love  revenge and sorrow  in short with humanity. with the film hara-kiri  masaki kobayashi signed one of the greatest philosophical films. the script by shinobu hashimoto is a good example on how to make a story clear but more importantly sufficient enough for anybody to understand the drama  in one word universal. also writer of jôi-uchi: hairyô tsuma shimatsu aka samurai rebellion (1967)  dai-bosatsu tôge (1966) aka sword of doom or ""hitokiri"" aka tenchu (1969)  shinobu hashimoto is among the greatest writers of the 7th art. i can not recommend seppuku enough  every single frame  acting  piece of music is irreproachable. the story is profoundly humanist  timeless and universal. i suggest we all confront the codes of our respective societies in order to find out if they still make sense or if they are leading us towards a terrible social hara-kiri"
"i saw harakiri (seppuku) in a new 35 mm print at nyc's film forum. this is a brilliant use of a narrow period genre to explosively indict politics and culture. writers shinobu hashimoto and yasuhiko takiguchi surely must have been as inspired by ""the count of monte cristo "" ambrose bierce and howard hawks' westerns as much as by samurai literature and movies.the film begins deceptively as a story within a story  seemingly providing a traditional example of upholding samurai honor  such as in the conventional  oft-retold tale of ""the 47 ronin."" the context is set at a time when the central government  the shogunate  is supplanting local clans and arbitrarily unemploying thousands of people  notably their samurai  forcing them into the mercenary mode of ronin at best and begging for food at worse. but the parallels to the 20th century are made repeatedly explicit as the samurai who comes to this clan seeking help is from hiroshima.very gradually we get further insight on the tale within a tale  as we see more flashbacks within flashbacks into what each character has been doing before these confrontations and we get uneasy inklings that the moral of the story may not be what it appears at first and the stakes get higher and higher with almost unbearable tension.it is almost halfway through the film until we see a female and we suddenly see an alternative model of masculinity  where a priority is put on family  support  education and creative productivity. in comparison to the macho opening relationships  with their emphasis on formal militaristic loyalty to a hierarchy  a loving husband and father is practically a metrosexual. seeing the same stalwart samurai making casual goo goo sounds to his grandbaby puts the earlier  ritualized scenes in sharp relief  particularly the recurring image of the clan's armor which seems less and less imposing and is finally destroyed as an empty symbol.the psychological tension in the confrontations in the last third of the film is more excruciating than the actual violence. even when we thought we already knew the outcome from the flashbacks  the layers of perception of relationships and personalities are agonizingly peeled away with each thrust of a sword to reveal the depths of the horrifying hypocrisy of the political and social structure. and those are just the overwhelming cultural resonances that a 21st century american can glean. like ""downfall (der untergang) "" it reveals the inhumane mentality that led to world war ii.the repeating motif of long walks then confrontations down empty corridors emphasizes the stultifying bureaucratic maze that entraps the characters. the revenge motifs are accented by startlingly beautiful cinematography that recalls traditional japanese art  including drops of blood like first snow flakes then a waterfall.the over all effect of this masterpiece is emotionally draining."
shichinin no samurai is a quintessential kurosawa movie  and probably his greatest lagniappe to the world of cinema. shichinin no samurai is a classic example of a profound character study well complemented by some ingenious direction and breathtaking cinematography. the world of cinema owes a colossal debt to the master movie-maker and plethora of his sui generis works such as this one. the movie depicts penury with sheer brilliance and uncanny resplendence. the inexorable resolve exhibited by the destitute villagers to fight the rapacious bandits can be inspiring even to the most pessimistic. the fidelity shown by the samurai to the villagers  each hired for a bowl of rice  accentuates the very essence of humanity. the movie's slow pace and its poignant background score enriches it with a sense of melancholy  thereby making it truly mesmerizing to watch. the entire cast has performed really well  taking care of the nuances with utmost precision and incredible conviction. kurosawa's plaintive storytelling  coupled with his subtle brilliance  makes the movie a truly ineffable experience for the viewer. ps. though not meant for everyone  the movie is sine qua non for cineastes and avid lovers of pristine cinema. it's also a great means to get acquainted with kurosawa's oeuvre before exploring his more personal works like rashomon  ikiru  ran  etc.http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/
"the archetypal action film  seven samurai is also one of the richest works to ever be committed to celluloid. each of its characters is extraordinarily realized; each has his or her own arc  his or her own vital part to play in the film's slow progression towards its dramatic finale. typically  kurosawa has put the film together using an exceeding degree of artistry; each and every shot  each action sequence  is exquisitely composed; and yet none seems contrived or out-of-place within the overall fabric of the work. everything is beautifully conceived and in focus  both literally and figuratively.when watching seven samurai  movie lovers will immediately recognize that several of its key elements can be readily detected in countless similar films made during the last half-century. the audition scenes  in which several samurai are recruited for the difficult task of defending a farming town from a group of bandits  strikes a particularly familiar chord  as do those showing the samurai training the lowly villagers to fight and use weapons. indeed  the theme of a highly experienced group of ""tough guys"" taking up the cause of the disenfranchised has become something of an action film cliche  portions of which echo throughout the american western  as well as its progeny (think the dirty dozen  the road warrior or even television's the a team).but what really stands out in seven samurai are its characters. they run the gamut  from elder teacher to hopeful youth  stoic warrior to undisciplined brigand. kurosawa even finds room for a youthful romance  not to mention the mix of poor and beleaguered townspeople he depicts within the setting of the town. perhaps its no wonder the enemy bandits are virtually faceless-- there is so much conflict and passion present within the group of protagonists  the villains need not be more than a vague threat. through it all kurosawa never forgets who these people are and where they stand in comparison to one another. obviously  the samurai are  for the most part  samurai  while the townspeople are merely peasants  lacking even in funds to pay their noble defenders. kurosawa deftly illustrates these class differences by having one peasant fear horribly for the honor of his daughter  who he suspects will be lured by the wealth of the samurai; and also by giving us one samurai who is no samurai at all  but merely a peasant himself whose own farming village was in his youth destroyed by marauding warriors. the film thus wraps a a portrait of class conflict in a cloak of solidarity. the samurai unite to defend the poor peasants  but the ending is not exactly happy for them. nor are the peasants completely honorable. we learn  for instance  that they have in the past murdered defeated samurai and looted their bodies  and it becomes apparent late in the film that their claims of poverty are perhaps not as truthful as at first seemed apparent.so why do the samurai defend them so valiantly? for honor? for love of adventure? the answer to this question is left intentionally vague; it is up to each viewer to draw his or her own conclusions. it is to the film's credit that it forces such questions upon us while never allowing them to cause the motivations of its characters to seem untrue.modern viewers will find the action sequences of seven samurai to be restrained. there are  for instance  no ""gladiator"" or ""braveheart"" moments in which limbs are visibly hacked off  blood flies and speakers pound with booming audio. but the action is wonderfully filmed and there is some early use of slow motion to accentuate key moments. the 3 1/2 hour running time may also deter some  but i find the length to be one of the film's charms; it takes its dear sweet time in exposing its riches  and no single moment feels underdeveloped or awkward. don't miss it.10/10"
"criticizing it's a wonderful life is almost an act of treason in this country  but if ever a movie deserved a closer look  it's this one.far from being a celebration of the importance of the individual  or of small-town life  ""it's a wonderful life"" depicts most citizens of bedford falls as timorous weaklings. moviegoers identify with the hero  george  of course  but he's the exception in this movie  not the rule. if any general lesson is to be learned from the story  it's that a willful leader is the only thing preventing ordinary small-town folk from losing not only prosperity  but morality.the evidence is plain: without george bailey to hold the town together  it becomes pottersville  which is a hays code version of gomorrah. the townsfolk haven't got the courage or sense to manage their own affairs without a leader. in bedford falls  that's either corrupt potter or long-suffering george. the only other characters with any backbone are harry bailey and sam wainwright  and they both left town. what remains are virtual ciphers like mr. gower  uncle billy  ernie  and bert. america doesn't exactly burst at the seams with self-reliant citizens  according to frank capra. so why does this movie merit a healthy 7 rating? two reasons:1. because it has undeniable power. capra was a good director-- but a great propagandist. he made patriotic short films for the u.s. army from 1942 until 1948-- and ""it's a wonderful life"" was made in 1946  smack in the middle of that period. the film is a masterpiece of manipulation. people love it  watch it over and over again every year  never noticing that its real message is deeply cynical  presenting little hope for mankind  and almost no faith in it. indeed  it is almost fascistic in the way it champions the idea of a single leader (or worse  divine intervention) taking charge over ineffectual ordinary middle class people.2. because capra proves himself right with his own movie. as an influential leader/filmmaker  he is skilled enough to make generations of sheep-like americans cry and cheer at his movies  no matter how much he insults us."
honestly  i don't think i've ever seen anything quite like it's a wonderful life. does it take me back to that place in my heart  that makes me long for everything that once was great and it could be again? does it remind me of my childhood  christmas in my home? no. maybe it's just simply what i always wanted from life and every man i want to be. everything about this film is well for lack of better words  perfect. no question to it any longer  the best performance by an actor i have ever seen. it's more than just beautiful  timeless or fair. all of stewart is revealed. everything coming together for capra. lionel barrymore at his best  which seems to be his worst. sometimes i think there is a reason why somethings happen. and i'm pretty sure there is some magical reason why this film was made. i'm 27 years old and saw it for the first time christmas eve of this year. i've watched it 3 times since. the only movie to ever make me cry. i probably wouldn't have all the answers for you  if you asked me why. i'm still trying to figure stewart out and just how beautiful was reed.what can i say? this movie is a life changing experience. makes me feel good to be alive. what a wonderful little world it is. and if i waited my entire life  it would not be a waste of time.
joaquin phoenix gives heath ledger a run for his money  true story. this is not a popcorn fluff comic book flick. do not take your kids to see this movie. shut down all ballots for the oscar  joaquin is taking that one home hands down. one of the best origin stories ever put out. the only downside to this movie  is that it is a stand alone film that will have no sequels or ties to the dc universe. todd philips take on the joker is one of pure brilliance and joaquin phoenix was the joker we deserved. he didn't steal from jack or heath but yet you got a taste of both.
every once in a while a movie comes  that truly makes an impact. joaquin's performance and scenography in all it's brilliance. grotesque  haunting and cringy. hard to watch at times ... but so mesmerizing  you won't blink an eye watching it. tragic  but with seriously funny moments. emotional rollercoaster - sometimes  with multiple emotions popping-up at the same time.this is far from a typical action-riddled predictable super-hero movie - it's a proper psychological thriller/drama  with the single best character development i have ever seen.
"my non-musician friends love this film and insisted i see it. i've been a jazz musician for over 30 years and have taught in a jazz university for over 20. so they figured i would relate. sorry  this is total crap and it makes me sad to think that the average guy out there thinks kenny g is cool and this film is a hard-edged depiction of the high-pressure jazz school scene. first of all  no prof would be there a day after any of the rehearsals terence ran  he'd be dismissed immediately (not hard to do  apparently this school didn't have tenure). and next  jazz is communication  conversation  thoughtfulness  and a big dollop of joyful soul. any drummer with the competitive mean-spirited attitude shown by any of these students would find themselves in extremely lonely company  nobody appreciates that. this is the 21st century equivalent of mickey rooney and judy garland saying  ""i know  let's build a show to save the town!"" as a representation of show biz. it's hollywood hokum  folks  and i resented its basic assumptions. where is the soul? that said  j.k. simmons is great  working with what he's got. and the cinematography and editing are well done (what is all that water on the cymbals we see so often? sweat? if elvin jones had gained two hundred pounds he wouldn't have sweated like that! oh well.) which is why i grudgingly added two stars to this. it's been a while since i so disliked a film. p.s. my drummer plays better than any of these guys. hah!"
"http://switchingreels.com/2014/01/28/sundance-review-whiplash/ever had a dream of being a great football player? a great dancer? a great singer? a great musician? our protagonist has a dream of being a great drummer  a drummer that will be remembered forever. maybe you are still fighting for your dream. maybe you have given up on greatness. greatness doesn't come easily  you need to practice at it. andrew practices until his hands bleed.andrew (miles teller) is 19-year old student at a music conservatory in manhattan. terrence fletcher (j.k. simmons) is a teacher at the conservatory with a ruthlessly brutal teaching style. after picking andrew to play in the school band  he pushes andrew to his limits in order to realize his full potential  at the risk of his humanity.i had a billiards teacher at one point in my life  who was close to becoming a pro in his craft but a grease fire accident changed all that. his perspective changed  to paraphrase  he realized he was becoming an asshole. he became a teacher of pool instead of becoming a pro player. through him  i can understand what terrence fletcher was trying to instill into andrew. my teacher would push me a little bit. when he gave me opportunities to show him up  ""run the table now "" he would tell me  i failed. it's embarrassing when that happens but it's also a learning tool because more work needs to be done. you can't get by on talent alone but it certainly helps. on the other side of it  i saw a little bit of my teacher in andrew. losing who you are to perfect something you love. good thing my teacher realized before it was too late.i lost myself in the story. it had something to say about not settling and asking more of yourself. two fantastic performances from miles teller and j.k. simmons. perhaps it will push you to maybe pick up that guitar again  put on your ballet shoes  or hit the gym to bulk up. whiplash is an incredibly powerful film. and after the final shot cuts to black  the film will stick with you for days.my expectations: medium. i did not expect the film to be so powerful for me. expectations exceeded.recommendation: cinema lovers and casual movie goers  i believe will enjoy this film.re-watch value: i can watch this film again and i actually can't wait until it hits distribution.memorable: i am still thinking about this film."
"it's not because i'm french that i appreciated this movie which i've seen twice. too give the really infamous appreciation of the reader from toronto to the french public  qualifying us of a segregationist country is difficult to gulp especially coming from north america which has not a very glorious past on the matter even in recent years. perhaps the commentator should see the movie ""the help"" to refresh his memory... but what i'd like to say here apart of praising the fabulous interpretation of both leading actors is to remind that this is a true story  it did not come out from the directors and scriptwriter heads.philippe pozzo di borgo born in 51  got a dramatic para-glider accident in the french alps in 1993 being totally deprived of movements from the base of his neck to the tip of his feet. 3 years later his wife died and he was helped out of his depression by abdel sellou his life-aid assistant. he published his terrible story in 2001 under the title ""the second breath"" (in french ""le second soufflé""). the directors have had the compliments of di borgo for the way they adapted his story. if in any way this was biased he would never had accepted the film to be left in that state. the di borgo family is a very old and wealthy family whose origins goes far back in the history of france  and their residence in paris is considered to be one the jewels of the capital at the same level as the hotel de sully in paris. what is shown in the film is exactly what happens everywhere in the world as far as handicapped are concerned: tendency to overwhelm them with pity which is more diminishing them as if their fate is not enough for them to swallow every minute or second each day. the way the racial problem is viewed is properly demonstrated. the police behaves in different ways depending of the color of your skin or your country's origin and sorry to say north america is a very good example of this so perhaps is not a proper judge on this matter.the authors had the courage to state this straightforwardly. the film shows on the contrary how a man with a very limited education at the beginning  a former convict  is capable progressively to change his views  and find in himself at the same time the good samaritan aspects and help with humor and punch  his handicapped boss to find a new belief in his shattered life at 42! at the same time the boss demonstrates an open-mindedness which was not obvious to get not only because of his handicap but because of his origins and his wealth at first. let's not illusion ourselves on the matter  everywhere in the world few wealthy people would accept to have as an aid an ex convict whichever color his skin should be! it's a fantastic lesson of tolerance  and friendship. for just those reason this movie would deserve an oscar or golden globe awards.09/07/2013 : i've just seen that under ""crazy credits"" is mentioned that 5% of the revenues of the film will go to an institutions caring for disabled persons. i just don't see what's crazy about that! i find this kind of remark particularly shocking and insulting both for the producers and the actors especially in this case where the story told is a true one.i suggest the administrator to delete that remark or change its qualification."
"do not look at this through the prism of ""foreign films"". you'd be wasting your time and miss something far too important.hollywood does scale like nobody else  leaving the competition gasping in its wake. france does intimacy  and brutality. nothing is sacred. and rather than try to revive the new wave or emulate hollywood like most widely seen french films of late  ""intouchables"" harnesses its core strengths - ease with intimacy  willingness to ridicule anything and brutal honesty - and delivers one of the funniest  most honest and touching films i have ever seen.sy is a failed robber  going through the motions and playing the stereotypical jobless émigré. cluzet is a romantic and melancholy mind trapped in a useless body. the circumstances that bring them together are too funny to spoil here  but meet they do  and an awkward relationship quickly blossoms as they bring out the best in each other.the film's simplicity is delightfully misleading: the script is a masterpiece of comedy writing  and however good the rest of the cast is  the central duo is magical. sy's comic timing will have you in stitches  but it is his honesty and vulnerability that make you fall in love with the character. cluzet isn't your typical sad-sack  instead  much of the finest pleasures in the film consist in watching him use his keen mind to mess with the world around him (a subplot about an abstract painting really takes the biscuit  you'll know it when you see it).this is one of the most unique  beautiful and honest friendships ever committed to film. it will make you laugh  it will make you cry... a delightful celebration of everything in life that makes it worthwhile."
you don't need to know anything but christopher nolan made the movie and that's the bottom line!
"great movie with great actors writers and twists.something that i didn't see anybody said about it that rivalry between two magicians is reference to tesla and edison's rivalry.
in the beginning they worked together  then became opponents. i think borden is tesla cause he always was more talented than angier (edison) who stole borden's idea.surely on of the best movies in this century  be sure to watch it more than one time."
first i saw 'the departed'. it was cool. then i saw 'infernal affairs'. it was awesome. then  after some time  i saw 'the departed' again. and i realized i've been conned. i wish there was a way to talk about 'the departed' without constant references to ia  but there isn't. this is not a re-imagining  it is not a remake or a tribute- it's a pure and simple rip-off  most of the time scene by scene  shot by shot. everything that is good  interesting or storytelling in 'the departed' originates in ia. all they did was change the setting and the language and dumb down the story here and there with some melodramatic/vulgar effects. speaking of vulgar; i don't give a s**t about 'ugly words'  some of the best movies are full of cursing  and hell  that's how people really talk after all. but... i just couldn't get past of how scenes that are subtle and cool in ia are almost systematically replaced with mindless cursing-orgies here. it's not that they curse it's that they only do that  as if a tirade wahlberg-style could actually replace acting and real emotions. it seems like throwing in a dick-joke  adding some punches  yelling  being all f**k this and f**k that is what makes true 'realism'. even in minor scenes; in ia the mob-mole merely has a conversation with the psychologist; here he blows up  yells and runs away. after the cinema scene  when the cop nearly finds out who the mole is in ia you have a tense psychological scene; in the departed matt damon must stab somebody  apparently the director doesn't think it's cool enough without that. or the classic rooftop end scene- in ia the two opponents act calmly  with dignity- here there's cursing and fighting and punching instead of a shared moment of drama. in one word- it's cheap  something you wouldn't expect from scorsese and this cast.
one of the best films of the 21st century  the departed keeps you on the edge of your seat and is incredibly exhilarating and the characters are incredibly well written and given great backstory. the ending will shock you and everything that comes before is some of martin scorsese's best work.
"i knew roman polanski's talent but was not prepared to this descent to hell  described in painstaking detail. i'm physically upset after watching this film. the sense of disgust is real. how awful. how awful.i could not help identifying myself with the jewish poles in varsovia. i couldn't help thinking that the paralytic old man thrown down the window could be my grandfather. couldn't help thinking that the kid savagely pulled through the wall could be my brother. couldn't help thinking that the girl asking the ss-guard the wrong question and being killed just for that  could be myself.the film describes beastly destruction of any dignity  and yet the struggle for surviving despite everything  even if rationally you realise that  perhaps  it would be even better to end it all at once. it describes the dishonesty of people profiting of this situation to make business out of your misery. it describes your need of believing the words of men not of their word  if they promise you life. and affection and courage surviving despite all this.this film could make a good pair with ""der untergang"" with bruno ganz  which is also such a masterpiece that you may risk feeling sympathetic with the nazi. have you had this temptation? watch ""the pianist""."
"i can remember when this film came out i was adamantly against seeing it. i had my preconceived notions that it would be some other heroic jewish holocaust film where good triumphs over evil and in between we would see some brutal atrocities committed by the germans to add some flavour.how wrong i was.this is one of the best films i have ever seen and what it did to me i cannot describe in words. but in a nutshell  it moved me  made me cry  made me feel like i was in the polish ghetto in 1940  and ultimately made me kiss the sidewalks as i walked out of the theater and thanked god that i live in the free society that i do. roman polanski has proved that he is a great director with films like chinatown and rosemary's baby but this is his crowning achievement. i think the fact that this won the awards that it did at this years oscars goes a long way to validate the brilliance of this film. i believe that the oscar's are rigged for the most part and films and actresses and such win based more on their pedigree or business associations than anything else  so when it won best actor and director and adapted screenplay this year  it tells you that it should have won best picture but the weinsteins seem to have a spell over everyone  hence a charlatan like chicago takes top prize. sorry for the digression here but when you compare a ""film"" like chicago to a masterpiece like the pianist  there really is one clear cut winner. they handed out the statue to the wrong movie.the pianist follows up and coming piano player wlad spielzman from his days as a local hero to a prisoner of war to his time in the ghettos  surviving only by the kindness of strangers. i think many people have touched on this before but what makes this film so amazing and well crafted is because spielzman is a man that we can all relate to. he is not a hero  he is not a rebel and he is not a kamikaze type that wants and lusts after revenge. he is a simple man that is doing everything in his power to stay alive. he is a desperate man and fears for his life and wants to stay as low as he can. only from the succor he receives from others does he manage to live and breathe and eat and hide. and this is how i related to him. if put in his position  how would i react? exactly the way he did. this is a man that had everything taken from him. his livelihood  his family  his freedom and almost his life. there is no time for heroics here. adrien brody embodies the spirit of spielzman and his win at this years oscars was one of the happiest moments i have had watching the festivities. his speech was even better but that is a topic for another time.ultimately it is his gift of music that perhaps saves his life and the final scene that he has with the german soldier is one of the most emotionally galvanizing scenes i've witnessed. with very little dialogue  it is in the eyes  the face  the mouth and the sounds that chime throughout their tiny space that tell you all you need to know. i think it is this scene that won brody his oscar. this is one of the all time great performances.i think polanski spoke from the heart here. he has taken a palette of memories and amalgamated them with what he has read and given us one of the best films of our generation and any other. i think the pianist will go down as one of the best films of this century and when all is said and done  chicago will be forgotten the way ordinary people was forgotten and when people talk about the film the pianist  they will do so with reverence and respect. this is a cinematic masterpiece.10 out of 10"
there is so little to find wanting in this film and not wanting to merely repeat its many deserved praises  all i can do is question a couple of historical points.it is unlikely that a roman general would be sold into slavery and forced to fight in the arena. exiled  yes. killed maybe. asked to commit suicide to retain his property  most likely. it is unlikely that he would return to find his family crucified  of all things. romans were very specific about who got crucified and why. romans usually avoided it  no matter how cruel the tyrant(?) was.roman legionnaires would never have a tattoo unless they were barbarians who got one before joining a legion. marking or mutilating the human body was expressedly anti- roman. no statue or depiction exists of a main-period roman showing a body-marking. the bonding feature the writer was attempting was an inappropriate borrowing from the 20th century german ss.great entertaining movie nonetheless.
"ridley scott's gladiator is not a perfect film  i would think that the hardiest of fans  of which i'm firmly one  know this deep down. yet just like commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy  so does gladiator the film. enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the academy award acknowledgements it received.in narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme  something scott and russell crowe have never shied away from. there has to my knowledge as well  never been a denial of the debt gladiator owes to anthony mann's 1964 epic  the fall of the roman empire. some folk seem very irritated by this  which is strange because the makers of gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie  what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. and it bloody worked  the influence and interest in all things roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post gladiator's success is there for all to see.what we do in life echoes in eternity.so no originality in story  then. while some of the cgi is hardly ""grade a"" stuff  and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required  yet the way gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. crowe's maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. as he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations  we are with him every step of the way  urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with crowe superb in every pained frame  winning the academy award for best actor that he should have won for the insider the previous year.backing crowe up is joaquin phoenix giving commodus preening villainy and connie nielsen graceful as lucilla (pitch nielsen's turn here against that of diane kruger's in troy to see the class difference for historical period playing). oliver reed  leaving the mortal coil but leaving behind a spicy two fold performance as proximo the gladiator task master. olly superb in both body and cgi soul. richard harris tugging the heart strings  derek jacobi classy  david hemmings also  while djimon hounso gives juba - maximus right hand man and confidante - a level of character gravitas that's inspiring.i didn't know man could build such things.dialogue is literate and poetic  resplendent with iconic speeches. action is never far away  but never at the expense of wrought human characterisations. the flaming arrows and blood letting of the germania conflict kicks things off with pulse raising clarity  and scott and his team never sag from this standard. the gladiator arena fights are edge of the seat inducing  the recreation for the battle of carthage a stunning piece of action sequence construction. and then the finale  the culmination of two men's destinies  no soft soaping from scott and crowe  it lands in the heart with a resounding thunderclap. a great swords and sandals movie that tipped its helmet to past masters whilst simultaneously bringing the genre alive again. bravo maximus decimus meridius. 10/10"
"when i first heard of ""american history x "" i thought it was going to be ""just another movie."" man  was i wrong! the first time i watched it  i sat there as it ended  and i was just completely in a state of shock. this movie  more than any other movie i had seen on the subject of racism  really made me think twice about how i treated people of a different race. the way that derek vinyard's family was almost completely split apart and destroyed due to his racist beliefs should be a wake-up call to those people who have any racist beliefs whatsoever. i believe that this movie was a whole lot more than just a ground-breaking  controversial drama; it was a portrayal of exactly how much damage can be done to a family and a nation simply because of the hate for a person or people of a different color  for almost no reason at all. the bible says that ""god created man in his own image."" it also says to  ""love your neighbor as yourself "" which  right there  implies that racism is not something people should even consider. i wouldn't recommend that anyone under the age of 16 see this movie due to its graphic content and language; however  i believe that everyone who is over the age of 16  should see this movie at least once. this way  more people will get a chance to see the true consequences of racism  and how it can easily tear apart a family."
i give this movie a 10 because1) edward norton was the meaning of masterful acting  you could just look at his eyes and understand every little pain he felt and caused. his smile and manner switching before and after was so distinguishing that if you did not speak english you could just follow him.2) cinematography : not only the black and white phase was amazing some other shots was masterful3) the cause   i watched this movie in 2019 and it is as important and as relevant as it was 21 years ago
the usual suspects  is  in my mind  one of the most fantastic pieces of film-making ever to grace our screens. that a group of people can come up with a piece of fiction that is so excellent in every way  from start to finish  is frightening. who knows  maybe this film has no superior.a lot is made of the film's ending. not for a moment am i going to let slip what exactly that is. i would never deny another film lover the sheer sense of amazement that ran through my body when the film reached its climax. while not the film's only strong point; this is a masterpiece all the way through  the ending will blow you away.the cast is  in a word  flawless. kevin spacey has  as far as i am concerned  never been better. he turns in a performance that is so moving and outstanding that he should have got three oscars. but he is not alone. byrne is fantastic  del toro adds continental flair  and postlethwaite is disturbingly dark  yet calculated.by all means watch this film  and observe its strong points  from bryan singer's masterful direction to the equally pleasing musical score. prepare yourself for a rollercoaster ride and the best ending ever in a film made anywhere in the world. i mean that.oh  and when you have finished; by all means  watch it again!9.7/10nothing in life is 100% perfect now is it?
"ah  the usual suspects. my personal favorite movie of all time. don't let my bias be a fool. perhaps it's not the best movie ever  but it's one that i never get tired of.if you like flash and bikinis and breath-taking camera angles  you won't find them here. usual suspects is not an ""epic "" and it doesn't pretend to be. it's a modestly-budgeted piece by a fresh director (who later went on to do the x-men movies  a far departure).a great  gritty script  beautifully-acted characters  and what many have called the greatest movie ending of all time  are some of the shining qualities that make the usual suspects an object worthy of praise above its humble-looking shell.the casting is very unusual but somehow fits perfectly. gabriel byrne is convincing as the ex-con trying to build a new life when he gets drawn back into his old life. stephen baldwin has the role of his career as the smart-mouthed and cocky professional. kevin pollak takes a big departure from his usual good comedy self to take a more dramatic role. benicio del toro literally takes a one-dimensional character with absolutely nothing in the script to give him character  and he fleshes it out with brilliant mannerisms and memorable mumbling to show incredible acting creativity. kevin spacey as we know him was born from this movie. his manners and fast-talking yet shy gimp nature are a treat to listen to throughout the flick.without giving away the plot  the best and most genius parts of the movie are the subtleties. after you see the ending  and the truth hits you like a ton of bricks  you have to watch it again. on the second time through  you'll jump up and point at the screen whenever you spot a clue you missed the first time. it's even possible to watch the movie multiple times and see something new with every viewing. it's that attention to detail that make the deceptively innocent-looking usual suspects one of the greatest movies of all time."
this is a modern and updated lolita and as a bonus comes with action and violence too. impressive.it has the sexual tension  the modern and contemporary sensibility and also glorified violence.great film.
"luc besson's movie léon (the professional) gives us an intense story which is maximized in potential by the casting of the movie done by todd thaler.  every aspect of the movie delivers to the audience and makes an impressive overall package.  jean reno plays a character named  léon who has learned to repress his emotions in order to perform his job as a ""cleaner""  or hit-man.  his secluded world is shattered by the young girl named mathilda who lives on the same floor as he does in an apartment building. when she turns to him for help  he learns about living a normal life  even if the circumstances which unite them are far from normal.the performance delivered by then twelve-year old natalie portman as mathilda is nothing short of brilliant.  her ability to relate to others with body movement and facial gestures is matched by few  she really brings raw emotion and believability to a difficult role.  mathilda and léon are unexpectedly thrown together  but learn to value life from their chance encounter  and how valuable a friendship can be.jean reno as léon gives us a solemn and calculated character who sets all of his energy on his assignments until her is given something else to care about.  mathilda gives him the daughter that he never had  while léon serves as a father and friend to her.  gary oldman  as the corrupt dea agent norman stansfield  offers the viewers an amazingly wired and electrical performance which pushes the envelope.  he moves the story along by his actions.  oldman offers us a memorable portrait of a sadistically obsessed man who stops short of nothing to get what he wants.the professional is what movie-making is all about.  without the overuse of special effects  a large shooting location  or a commercially star studded cast  we are given all that could possibly be asked for in a movie.  portman  oldman  and reno  along with danny aiello as the hit-contractor tony remind us that there is no substitute for great acting. there are elements of comedy  drama  and action  and great original music by eric serra adds to the energy the film already encapsulates.  the most impressive thing about the movie is its story which is basic but is maximized by all the other elements which go into the making of the movie. simply put  an intense and impressive movie."
"this is truly one of the best disney movies ever. i really enjoyed it when i first seen it  about when i was 6  and since then i watched it over and over again. i simply looooved the music. it's one of the best soundtracks i've ever heard. and  speaking of soundtrack  i just can't tell in words how much i love the song ""can you feel the love tonight"". is one of my favorite songs ever. i truly believe that this motion picture could easily be nominated for the best picture  but the best song and the best original score is really enough. i wonder if they will ever think to make a prequel of this movie in order to understand who is mufasa  scar  sarabi and the other characters. in short  this movie will be remembered in the next 100 years. truly."
"seriously  i know that sounds stupid as this is an animated movie  but why can't we have a favorite movie that's animated? if you ask me this is disney's best animated film of all time. why do you ask? the animation is just beautiful  the story is powerful and moving  the characters are terrific  the villain is one of disney's most monstrous and the songs are out of this world incredible! not only is it my favorite animated movie  this is one of my favorite soundtracks  with the strong power of elton john the lion king is absolutely beautiful and a pleasure to watch still to this day. i have to say also that this story is just so beautiful  it's still one of the movies that will always bring a tear to my eye. when i was 17 years old  i begged my dad to take me to the re-release of the lion king  him and i being the only adults besides the parents who took their children to see the movie  simba's father dies and i started balling! my dad looks around and said ""krissy  stop it!"" and i just said ""but it's so saaaaad! simba's daddy!""  yes i'm a sap  i can't help it  this is a powerful movie.in the pride lands  rafiki  a wise old monkey  anoints simba  the newborn cub of king mufasa and queen sarabi  and presents him to a gathering of animals at pride rock. taking advantage of the cub's naive nature  simba's scheming uncle scar  who is very angry because simba's birth means that he's no longer next in line to the throne tells him about the elephant graveyard  a place where mufasa has forbidden simba to go. simba asks his mother if he can go to the water-hole with his best friend  nala  but they go to the graveyard instead. there  the cubs are met by shenzi  banzai and ed  3 hyenas who try to kill them  but they are rescued by mufasa. but scar doesn't give up there  he lures simba into a gorge for a ""surprise from his father"" while the hyenas create a wildebeest stampede. alerted by scar  mufasa races to rescue simba from the stampede. he saves his son but is left clinging to the edge of a steep cliff. scar flings his brother into the stampede below. simba sees his father fall and rushes down the cliff after him  only to find him dead. scar convinces simba that he was responsible for his father's death and recommends that he runs away from the pride lands to avoid punishment. in a distant desert  simba is found unconscious by timon and pumbaa  a duo who adopt and raise the cub under their worry-free philosophy  hakuna matata. when simba has grown into an adult he is discovered by nala  who tells him that scar  through his irresponsibility  has turned the pride lands into a barren wasteland. she asks simba to return and take his place as king but simba refuses  still believing he caused his father's death. rafiki arrives and persuades simba to return to the pride lands  and face scar once and for all.i know that still that beauty and the beast is the only animated film to get a best picture nomination  but i don't understand why the lion king didn't get the same treatment. i adore this film with such a passion  i will always defend it to the high end. i still watch this movie  ever since it's theatrical release in 1994  i still sing  dance  and rehears the lines back and forth. how could you not at least with hakuna matata? timon is my idol  he's so care free  funny  and awesome during his drag hula scene ""luau! if you're hungry for a hunk of fat and juicy meat  eat my buddy pumbaa here  'cause he's a tasty treat come on down and dine  on this tasty swine  all you gotta is get in line  are you achin' ? for some bacon? he's a big pig. you can be a big pig  too. oy! ahhhh!""  best scene ever in film history! ok  not in history  but one of my favorites  it always has me on the floor laughing till my stomach hurts. if you seriously haven't seen this movie  see it! who said that animated movies can't be true art? the lion king is a fantastic film and deserves all it's praise and more.10/10"
"15 years on and still terminator 2 remains a turning point in cinematic history introducing the world to photo-realistic computer generated 3d rendering. to this day  this is still an astounding achievement  however (ironically) these are the things that re-watching the film now  you notice as not being to the standard we now expect films to be.as a result of this  you're then forced to look beyond the graphics in search of other quality. when i last watched it (about 3 weeks ago)  something stood out to me that never did before because of no longer being mesmerised by the graphics.this was the interactions between characters who are gritting  no nonsense  hard edged people  but those who care deeply for one another. in particular  i'm referring to sarah and john connor  but also to the inhuman t-101 in all it's programming trying to humanise itself (at the demand if john).though these might sound like day to day interactions (pardoning the whole terminator and robotic elements here)  but to put them onto film and not have them feel forced or contrived is quite a feat  and all of these were achieved far above the expectation of one watching an ""action"" movie. you truly believe that john is devastated to have to lose t-101. you can tell he's fearful about sarah going off to kill the man who would kill the world  unwittingly.i urge you all to sit down and watch this film again. you will remember things you've long since forgotten  and maybe appreciate something you never even noticed was there before."
"a terminator(arnold schwarzenegger) was sent from the future to kill the unborn son of sarah connor(linda hamilton) in the original. now  that terminator has been sent back again but with a different assignment: protect john connor. john connor(edward furlong) is now about 10 years of age and must evade a new terminator sent to kill him;the t-1000(robert patrick). sarah  john  and the terminator journey together on their quest to stop judgement day  with a trailing  shape-shifting termiantor trailing from behind.this is the greatest of the terminator trilogy. i have watched three times in the past year and have not found anything that cameron could have improved on. the move is a masterpiece in every aspect of film. schwarzenegger's acting might not be incredible but this is the perfect role for him. he isn't supposed to show emotion or feelings. he is a machine. i hate almost every one of his movies besides this trilogy because he is a horrible actor but he works perfectly into this role.the special effects are incredible beyond belief. the shape-shifting t-1000 is some of the greatest animation i have witnessed in cinema history. it absolutely blew my mind when i first experienced this visual extravaganza. the animation looked so real(remembering this was a good ten years). the movie included fast-paced action along with some clever sci-fi drama/horror. the idea of a vast army of machines taking over the world after sending off warheads to every major city should be scary enough. but the t-1000 has very little lines and is just creepy enough to make twitch when you see him.sci-fi movies can rarely be made in such way that can be looked at as works of art. this is one of the few exceptions. the prediction of judgment day with hamilton watching a playground full of kids be burnt to the ground is an absolute brilliant portrayal of armageddon. the theme that men will destroy themselves is also shown throughout the movie also and is even said by the terminator"" it's in your nature to destroy yourselves"". this brings the movie to a whole new level of sci-fi.overall  termiantor ii: judgement day is an absolute must see classic. if you have not seen it  buy it! because once you have seen it  you will want to do so anyways. it is fast paced and highly enjoyable for just about every audience.i highly recommend this movie."
this movie definitely is one of my all time best movies. director giuseppe tornatore placed himself in the list of the best directors. the usage of an excellent background score is a trademark of his movies and this movie is not at all a different case.he is also a master in getting best performances out of children and adolescents. marco leonardi was the pick of the whole cast. also watch melena for those trademarks of tornatore.the character of alfredo is one of the most unforgettable characters. the way emotions captured in a camera is way beyond naturality.overall  this is a great movie with ultimate teamwork with everyone contributing. i just loved the movie very much.
"it is by now well known that there are two versions of this film that differ greatly  the original 3 hour italian cut and the heavily re-edited 2 hour version which was the version that charmed the world in 1989. it remains a wonderful experience  but the director's cut is so much richer  deeper  satisfying well everything. this review is of the director's cut which may not be the greatest film in the world but is my favourite film of all time ever since i came out of the cinema in which i first saw it in back in 1994 crying my eyes out. never has a film effected me as emotionally as this one. cinema paradiso is many things- a touching story of a friendship  a wonderful portrayal of a sicilian village  a loving tribute to the cinema  amongst other things  but the longer cut is i believe the most moving and romantic love story ever. for my money  you can forget casablanca dr zhivago titanic romeo and juliet etc {great as some of them are}  this is the one that does it for me.divided into three sections  it is the first section that was left almost intact in the short version. it is of course primarily concerned with the relationship between young toto and the projectionist of his local cinema  alfredo. it is full of delightful touches such as toto stealing a frame of film from behind alfredo's back  or when toto helps alfredo during an exam so he can be allowed into the projection booth  or perhaps best and simplest of all of all toto's spellbound face as he watches the footage that will be censored by the town priest. the cinema is portrayed as almost being the centre of life in the town giancaldo in which the film is mostly set. the actual sequences set in the cinema are full of wonderful observation and even some belly laughs. there's the man who only goes to the cinema to sleep and is always awoken by kids  the couple who see each other for the first time because everyone else is cowering from dr jekyll and mr hyde  the old man who says ""no  this is important"" when everyone else ""booos"" the news-all human life is here  with more observations and insights than in any mike leigh film. this section climaxes in a scene which is simply magical  when alfredo projects a film onto the wall of a house so everyone can see it.as the film moves forward several years to show toto as a 16 year old  the wonderful cinema scenes are still present. who can forget the cinema usher telling off a group of young boys for playing with themselves while watching brigitte bardot and then sheepishly giving his own manhood a little touch? director guiseppe tornatore also subtly reminds us of changing times  such as when television is first shown in the cinema. however  it is mainly concerned with toto's {now called salvatore} courtship of the girl he is in love with  elena. no one who has experienced the pangs of first love can fail to respond to such scenes as salvatore ranting on to elena on the phone how much he loves her and realising he's actually been talking to her mother  or the beautiful first kiss and embrace in the projection booth {of course}.it is in the final section  as salvatore  now a great film director  returns to giancaldo as a 50ish man to attend alfredo's funeral where the humour all but disappears {well  life gets more serious as one gets older  does it not?} and the pace does slow-be warned. it is possibly the most emotional hour of cinema ever  and was cut to about 15 mins in the short version. salvatore's reunion with elena  which also displays absolutely brilliant acting from jacques perrin and brigitte fossey  is so painful a sequence  as the two characters pour their hearts out to each other. as ennio morricone's love theme swells up {a truly heartbreaking piece of music} it ends up being one of the most beautiful love scenes ever filmed. salvatore's reunion with his mother and his exploration of the cobwebbed  dilapidated  cinema are also extremely moving. as for the final scene  where salvatore opens a certain gift alfredo left him-well there's been too many spoilers already in this review  but suffice to say it is matchless  simply matchless. it was moving in the short cut  but is three times more meaningful in the director's cut.cinema paradiso has been called sentimental  but in the director's cut it is a darker  deeper kind of sentimentality. maybe it is still ""a love letter to the cinema""  but it is also shows that obsessive love of something such as films can also result in sadness and regret. think of what happens to alfredo in the film  and as for salvatore  well  his curse is that he has two loves in his life but success in one of them comes at the expense of the other. the uncut cinema paradiso is more then anything else about life and the effect of the decisions we make. o  and the greatest  most heartbreaking love story ever {have i already said this!}"
"**spoilers**i saw ""hotaro no haka"" on german tv the other day and it has changed my life! never have i been so moved by a film in my whole life. i cried and cried and cried. since then i can´t get this heartbreaking story out of my head.after the movie i went upstairs to the bedroom  where my 3-year-old daughter was sleeping. i woke her up and took her in my arms. in the way she talks and acts she is just like setsuko  one of the main characters in the film. and i can´t help feeling like seita  her brother - because my daughter and i are alone since my wife left us a few months ago.i found one of the most touching scenes was the one where the dying setsuko starts sucking the buttons she collected  because she ran out of her special sweets. i will also never forget how her brother cremates her after having tried everything to save his little sister. the most depressing thing with this movie is: you feel so helpless. you think: man  i wish i could have helped those kids.this movie has changed my whole attitude to life. all the problems you may have - they become so small. watch it and you´ll be a different person.michael saunders"
"i decided to watch grave of the fireflies yesterday. my friends told me it was extremely moving and sad. i hesitated at first  but then i said ""oh well  i'll give it a try."" at the end of the film  i was crying my eyes out. this was the best animated film  i've ever seen.this is a moving depiction of the fates of cast-off children who become casualties of war.this movie isn't your regular animated film. pixar and disney put films out there with happy endings. i'm not saying there bad films at all. they are also great pieces of work. but grave of the fireflies tells you the truth. this movie isn't trying to entertain you. it wants to inform you about how war is really like. there were many moments in the movie  that just brought me to tears.i am kind of upset  that this movie didn't get many awards as it should. in that regards  it is very underrated and it is kind of thrown apart. when it should really be respected and praise it. if this movie was made in our time period right now. i would be 100% sure this would of won an oscar for best animated film. this is studio ghilbi's best movie they have ever released.i truly advice you to bring a handkerchief  cause chances are that you will cry.an emotional epic animated film  that i recommend everyone to watch.quite simply 10/10"
"back to the future is such an inventive and exciting piece of filmmaking that it is impossible to forget about it. the casting of every character involved was absolutely perfect  and the performances were spectacular. i first saw this film when i was six years old  and it is the only movie that i know of that i don't think i could ever get sick of.
one of the best things about back to the future is that it really makes you think. you can have in-depth conversations about the plausibility of the story-line and spend hours discussing the film. the story is awesome  it is delivered cleverly and entertainingly  and the movie as a whole is just so much fun that it can be forgiven whatever number of time-travel discrepancies that may be found in the plot. i cannot recommend this movie enough. i have never found a movie other than this one that provides such a huge dose of great fun  and it has the desirable quality where you are able to see something new each time you see it. the only problem is that they stopped at part iii."
"what can i say about this movie that was already said? it is my favorite time travel sci-fi  adventure epic comedy in the 80's and i love this movie to death! when i saw this movie i was thrown out by its theme. an excellent sci-fi  adventure epic  i love the 80s. it's simple the greatest time travel movie ever happened in the history of world cinema. i love this movie to death  i love  love  love it! i firstly saw this movie in the early 90's as a kid on vhs tape and i was blow away by the action and the score and the title back to the future. this movie is one of the best masterpiece time travel epic adventure film. michael j. fox and christopher lloyd are fantastic at acting. music theme score by alan silvestri is excellent i could listen to it whole day.back to the future (1985) from the academy award ""- winning team of steven spielberg"" and robert zemeckis** comes the hilariously groundbreaking adventure that thrilled critics and audiences alike - and sparked one of the most successful movie trilogy ever! directed by robert zemeckis the movie begins with marty mcfly (michael j. fox) a teenager who has a really messed up family. his ultimate goal was to become a rock star which was heartened by his girl friend jennifer parker (claudia wells). but things went wrong when scientist dr. emmett brown/doc (christopher lloyd) wanted marty's assistance for his new invention.at that night marty went to assist doc's invention the time traveling car ""delorean"". marty was told to record doc's first time travel to the future. at that instant they were attacked by some libyan terrorists who were cheated by doc for plutonium.after killing doc they turn towards to marty and without any intention marty enters the time traveling car. but it was previously set by doc and when activated marty gets transfer to 1955 from 1985.what will he do next  will he can come back to the future  or will he stuck back in the past for his rest of the life. more than that will his time travel make serious effects on the future? dealing with time travel and time paradox steven spielberg presents this amazing journey of marty set up in the time of 80's and 50's. scripted by robert zemeckis and bob gale for the story of bob gale himself  tells a science fiction adventure in a family oriented tone.they really work hard to sculpt that sci-fi thread into a thrilling  culture clashed family movie. a good story with a great script. also the soul of the movie was given by the legend alan silvestri. his composition was all memorable especially in the chasing and emotional scenes. over the top the theme music  it was the most dazzling and recognizable themes in the movie history.more than that the casting was simply brilliant  each and every actor is born to play their respected roles in this movie. michael j. fox was the only actor who can play the role of energetic marty mcfly  which was considered for numerous actors. also thomas f. wilson was brilliant in his performance as the bad boy biff tannen. lea thompson did a great work in portraying lorraine baines's two different life times  as a teenage girl and a matured mother. well the extra talented christopher lloyd had almost ""chewed every scenes"" in the movie. mr. lloyd's versatile performance as the madman and genius scientist dr. emmett brown is one of the great memorable roles in his carrier.last but not the least  it was crispin glover who steal the show as the nerdy teenager/father as george mcfly. it was an interesting portrayal as a boy who was transformed to a man. crispin glover lived in that part. i don't know whether the movie would be a masterpiece without his unique performance. above all i want to remember this as a romantic movie and it couldn't be made without the songs ""the power of love "" and ""earth angel"".the rating i am giving is 10/10 the original and the best one of all time. i love this film  it is my favorite time travel movie of all time and i love it to death! all in all it is the greatest sci-fi  romantic movie of all time. it is the part of the great movie history  which consider itself as "" a modern/classic masterpiece! """
"i never  never rate any movie less than 3/10 but i have to now! i have watched all the movies in 250 imdb list. 80% were well deserved in my humble opinion. some were good or even great but not great enough for this list. but no matter what i still enjoyed those ""good"" movies that (in my opinion) didn't deserve to be in the list until i watched this movie!! seriously i don't understand! it was pushed in the list like three weeks ago and i watched it not once but twice because i wanted to make sure it wasn't the first time watching! it's just ... not good!! and it has nothing to do with culture or things like that i have watched a lot of indian movies so don't even assume it was that. the movie itself lacks major elements and while it's trying to tell an intresting story it does it in a way that has been done a thousand times before and after the year it was made. it's that same subject : a man dying but rather than losing hope he lives life to the fullest and changes the others around him! such a clice of a story done with clice ways. the acting is not good at all. the story is not intresting enough. to the point that instead of enjoying it i was constantly waiting for it to end!i think the only reason this movie made this list was because the cast is famous in india and i think the people there wanted this movie on this list. that's the only explaination i can think of after seeing all of these 10/10!!! and almost half of them had the flag of india so ... !raiting this a 1/10 was the only thing i could do to balance the raiting after all these 10/10s!
the movie itself is a 4/10 for me."
"what an outstanding movie!! i have heard all the prior generation people rave about this movie  so  i decided to check this movie out myself. i only have faint memories of having watched parts of this movie from my mom's lap when she and dad were watching this in the theater. the other reason why i decided to check this out was a super-bowl half-time debate on whether amitabh was better than rajesh khanna. i could not participate in this debate for two reasons: first  i was eagerly awaiting another ""wardrobe malfunction"" for one of the cheerleaders and secondly  i only had memories of one rajesh khanna movie  haathi mere saathi. i remember having enjoyed it very much as a child. but that alone was not enough to quantify anything. the more recent performances of ab were fresh in my mind  but after having seen this movie  i decided that rajesh had a class of his own. his chirpy performance in this movie is really unparalleled! what an amazing performance! amitabh  being more junior  has not equaled rajesh  but has done his share very well. thus  even after watching this movie  the debate will continue.what's new? what can possibly be new in an old movie? guess what? there is plenty for the younger generation to take away! there is no education in the movies these days  whatsoever  except perhaps bedroom or bar sequences. the inadequacies in the field of medicine are so nicely brought forward by this movie  which is certainly over 30 years old! now  i can understand why munnabhai mbbs was such a hit. it had so beautifully adapted from this movie to match the present generation. kudos to vidhu vinod chopra and sanjay dutt (& kamal hassan too) for carrying this forward.noticeable: ""baaabumushaai""  the nick name for amitabh  as heard from rajesh throughout the movie  will ring in your ears even hours after you have seen the six letters ""the end"" on the screen. there really is no end to such people! some sequences were simply amazing. those that stood apart in my mind were the last scene  with a tape that had a significant pause in between; the moun-vrath guru  who so symbolically said that there is so much more than the decaying body to anand's soul; then of course the munirbhai sequences and the eventual backfiring of this strategy and so many more! the songs were so gentle and heart warming! the comic timing of rajesh khanna was simply amazing! verdict present day filmmakers really need to rework their brains and start thinking much much better! there is much more to hindi cinema than just skin-show and catchy item number songs. this is a must-watch movie! i did not think so when others told me  but having experienced it myself  i believe them! i am gonna check out the other must-watch movies prescribed by the previous generation."
as a fan of westerns  i saw this film many times in the early 90s. saw this recently again on a dvd aft many years. the plot- claudia cardinale arrives at her ranch  to find that her husband has been murdered by hired gun henry fonda. mysterious gunman charles bronson wants an appointment with fonda. bronson teams up with outlaw jason robards to help protect cardinale n her ranch from fondas evil intentions. there are long scenes where you get close shots of a person's face. sergio leone loves the stare-down  and you can see it in virtually all of his films. in this movie he allows the camera to linger longer than ever before. you get those quiet scoreless scenes where the natural sounds of the environment are greatly exaggerated. leone's opponents take a long time to feel each other out before they act. one may find the long stretches of silence and inaction tedious n boring. honestly  even i found some scenes boring  especially the opening scene. henry fonda is terrific. no one expected him to play such a ruthless and brutal killer. bronson was decent but jason robards was much better with his tip on guys patting females bottom n the tip on don't get shot by a person who doesn't know to shoot. one of the best part bah the film was ennio morricone's score  especially the recurring harmonica music during the final closing fight. this is morricone's best moment in a long  treasured career. i was surprised to know that the story was written by dario argento.
"this one only gets better with each viewing. leone's masterful storytelling and morricone's crazy  beautiful  epic soundtrack; desperate  haunted faces which look like the barren landscapes the story is set in and a plot that unfolds with impeccable pacing to culminate in the ultimate western finale.as in leone's previous films  music isn't just used to add to the atmosphere but is essential to the story  or perhaps even more: morricone's main musical theme plays the actual role of a (or rather: the) protagonist in the film. anyone who thought that the so called ""spaghetti westerns"" were nothing but cheap  violent b-movies had to reconsider after seeing this film. it doesn't get any better than this: this is movie history; iconic  classic  unforgettable  epic. for this film  i just run out of superlatives.my vote: 10 out of 10favorite films: http://www.imdb.com/list/mkjokvqlsbs/lesser-known masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/favorite low-budget and b-movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/favorite tv-shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/"
"a seminal classic of horror by master alfred hitchcock  with some of the most memorable iconic scenes in the history of cinema. tense  horrific and a superb lesson in filmmaking  it offers well-constructed characters  a lot of revealing dialogue and a huge regard for details.
hitchcock's classic ""comedy"" featuring the world's most famous mother's boy is one of the most influential films ever made; every serial killer and slasher movie owes something to this  one of the true greats of cinema."
"no matter how many times one sits through this hitchcock classic  anthony perkins always manages to surprise you. it is a sensational performance - for which he didn't even get an oscar nomination - i have no way of knowing how much preparation he dedicated to the creation of norman bates  maybe no more than usual  but the details of his performance are astonishing. never a false move and if you follow the film looking into his eyes  you'll be amazed as i was. the madness and the tenderness  the danger and the cravings. a mamma's boy with hellish implications and yet we see  we feel connected to the human being  we are not horrified by him but of his circumstances. in short  we kind of understand him. that alone puts him miles and miles away from other cinematic monsters. from richard attenborough as the real life christie in ""10 rillington place"" to the hideous  unredeemable christian bale in ""american psycho"". here hitchcock and herrman create an universe that anthony perkins inhabits with the same kind of electricity  nerve and shyness that norman bates projects throughout the film. janet leigh falls for it if not him. she  like us  sees the boy trying to escape his dutiful son's trap. he is in my list of the 10 most riveting characters ever to be captured on film."
"while my personal bogey favorite is still his sam spade in 'the maltese falcon'  his cynical nightclub owner  rick  in 'casablanca'  is also a standout. rather than some ""off the cuff"" comments  i'll quote instead from my article on claude rains (from march 2000 issue of classic images) that pretty well sums up the film:""it was 1943's 'casablanca'  bustling with melodramatic wartime intrigue  that really put him (claude rains) in the forefront as one of the screen's smoothest character actors  almost--but not quite--stealing the film from humphrey bogart and ingrid bergman  as the uniformed captain louis renault who investigates the goings-on at rick's notorious cafe.
nobody associated with the film guessed that it would become a screen classic  least of all its director  michael curtiz  the prolific wb director to whom it was just another assignment.  it went on to win the oscar for best film of 1943 with an award for curtiz' taut direction.oddly enough  the film's memorable airport ending was written and conceived just shortly before filming wrapped up  with neither bergman nor bogart knowing whether or not she would leave him for husband paul henried. wartime audiences loved the film. sydney greenstreet  conrad veidt  victor francen and peter lorre all gave sterling performances and rains was again nominated for best supporting actor.""and by the way  i disagree with a former comment indicating the black and white photography of this film was primitive as compared to today's. incredible nonsense!!  as a matter of fact  the film's black and white cinematography was nominated for an oscar!ingrid bergman was at the peak of her radiant beauty in this one--and bogey was firing on all six cylinders. great chemistry! as time goes by  we still have 'casablanca'..."
"there are literally hundreds of comments about this movie on imdb.  many of them exhort its greatness.  i don't disagree with them.but i'd like to add a suggestion to those of you out there who haven't seen this film.  i'd like to tell you how to watch it.the people who made this movie didn't think they were producing a masterpiece. bergman left the shoot disgusted.  the screenwriters were on salary for warners  writing half a dozen movies a year  and this was just one more.  bogie was punching the clock in the middle of a workhorse career.so as an audience member  you can't sit down expecting gilded greatness.don't have a casablaca party.  don't watch it on your first date  hoping it will lend that ""romantic touch.""  don't watch it as part of your ""i need to watch the best 10 movies of all time"" film school project.buy this movie on dvd.  have it at the ready.  and then  one friday night  when your plans fall through and you find it's 10:30pm and there's nothing on tv that's any good  open a six pack of beer  or pour yourself some wine  and watch this movie in a darkened room.the characters in casablanca are absolutely devoid of sentimentalism.  every one of them sees the world without a hint of rose color in their lenses.  as rick says  ""three little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this big old world.""  if you're in a mood where you understand what he's saying  watch this movie and it will transport you.there is no single movie that deserves to be called the best movie of all time.  because movies  when all is said and done  don't amount to a hill of beans.  they are meant to entertain us  not for us to worship them.but no movie has ever known this fact like casablanca.

this mostly silent movie deals with a little man   a disgraced factory worker who goes insane from his repetitious job at an assembly líne . at the same time the exigent boss demands him for greatest efficiency and speed at work . as the unfortunate man moving from hapless factory worker to singing waiter and ultimately triumphing along the way .an interesting and thought-provoking chaplin film encompassing the tyranny of machine over man  this great film has more relevance nowadays than ever. the pic contains a sour denounce on capitalism   industrialization and human explotiation . this is a vintage flick much in the fashion that sound films offended his pantomimist's sensibilities . this is a silent movie   being the only dialogue a song sung by chaplin in gibberish italian .chaplin gives an awesome and sympathetic performance as a labourer who goes crazy and triumphs over adversity   just as charles the film director proved victorious over sound . chaplin also composed the score which incorporates the charming tune : smile. his spouse to be paulette goddard is attractive in the femenine lead   playing a poor orphan. look for a young gloria de haven   as one of paulette goddard's sisters . she is the real-life daughter of chaplin's assistant director .the motion picture was masterfully directed by charles chaplin .this was one of the longest ones to that date . chaplin previously directed 2 or 3 reel short movies  such as : our hero  the fireman  night at the show   the adventurer  the floorwalker  the cure   the inmigrant   the circus   burlesque on carmen   among others . after that   he made long feature films such as : the gold rush   the kid   city lights   the great dictator   monseur verdoux   limelight  a king of new york and his last one : a countess from hong kong . rating 8/10 . better than average . well worth watching .
"charlie chaplin's modern times (1936) is the final film to feature the great actor/director/writer's most easily recognizable incarnation: the tramp. here is a character that is so ingrained in the collective conscious of modern film audiences that many recognize him despite the fact that they have not seen a single chaplin film. indeed  several iconographic studies have labeled the tramp (with his worn hat  distinctive mustache  dusty suit  cane  and trademark waddle) as the single most identifiable fictional image in history.still  the film that perhaps most influenced the creation and thematic realization of modern times was not even a silent one. the jazz singer  which debuted in 1927  five years before modern times began production  is perhaps the most important watershed film in the industry's century-old history. in the film  comic great al jolson stands up in front of the audience and...sings. and as millard mitchell said in singin' in the rain  the public was suddenly in a frenzy for ""talking pictures! talking pictures!"" sadly  with the advent of synchronized sound and dialogue  the world of silent filmmaking began to slip into obscurity with audiences and studios now viewing it as obsolete and undesirable. nevertheless  chaplin continued his passion for the subtle craft by creating city lights (1931)  which many critics and academics consider one of the greatest films ever made  but by the time modern times was released  chaplin was one of the last directors left clinging to a dying art.modern times is not an entirely silent film  (there are dialogue snippets and sound effects)  but if you look closely  every character with dialogue (excluding chaplin himself) is being mocked. even when the tramp opens his mouth (the only time he ever did so in a film)  the words are nonsensical  defying the burgeoning convention that dialogue is mandatory for substance  entertainment  and quality.despite the film's status as one of the greatest comedies of all-time  it is hard to ignore the political component. in his movies  chaplin often exhibited a great mistrust for authority and progress  as often embodied through the social elite  the police  and wealthy entrepreneurs. the irony of the film's title  then  is two-fold. it connects with chaplin's own bitter feelings regarding his moribund art form  but also refers to the plight of the working classes during the great depression (long working hours with little job security and meager salary  while the upper classes remain wealthy and bide their idle time) the world was changing fast  and chaplin foresaw that many of these changes were far from beneficial.as we watch the tramp struggle through the modern  mechanized world  we laugh at his antics and the absurdity of their results  but we can also feel pain and pity. he is clearly a man who does not belong. indeed  the tramp can almost be thought of as a misfit who has passed through a membrane from some alternate reality and unwittingly fallen into our familiar world (notice that he does not have a name or identification of any kind  and as far as we know  he has no friends  family  funds  or history).he takes on assembly lines  feeding machines  department stores  policemen and various other mass-oriented aspects of the industrialized world (all which demand and exhibit sameness and conformity)  but the tramp (and his symbolic extension  the individual) never seem to fit.this is  consequently  why modern times is also one of the most poignant love stories ever put on film. the only character who is on the same level as the tramp is a young  homeless woman who is referred to as ""the gamin"" and is played by chaplin's then-wife  paulette goddard. these two are brought together by the fact they have almost nothing except the will to live and continue forward  despite adversity. both are nameless  neither has a home  and they each have no money or material possessions.it is here that chaplin makes his most poignant and saddening statement about modern living. the tramp and the gamin are the only characters who exhibit individuality and idealism  yet they are also the ones lowest on the social and economic food chain. the conclusion of the film  which most likely reflects upon chaplin's own emotions  is tinged with sadness  but also a lingering hopefulness that resonates as loudly and clearly today as it did more than sixty years ago.then there is  of course  the comedy  which is the stuff of legendary status. some of the most memorable comic images in film history are found in modern times. these include the tramp's bout with an assembly line (and his resulting twitches)  his unfortunate encounter with ""nose-powder""  the moment when he quite literally becomes a cog in the wheels of industry  and his epic struggle to bring roast duck to an angry customer.in my opinion  however  the two standout moments are the scene in a department store involving a blindfold and some rollerskates (the most exquisite moment of comedy in the film) and the sequence where the tramp is submitted to the mad whim of an out-of-control feeding machine (the most uproarious moment in the film).these are just a handful of moments that make modern times the enduring masterpiece that it is. on a personal level  the aspect of the film that resonates strongest with me is its appeal to the idealistic misfit in all of us. in our hearts  many of us long for the simplicity and exuberance with which the tramp and the gamin live life (with attention to the bare essentials and an absence of need for materialism and modern trappings).as chaplin so skillfully shows  however  our modern times make this lifestyle a faded dream  lost among the sheep-like herds of men and women scurrying through a modern metropolis that only fritz lang could make seem darker and more devoid of true humanity. still  the final image of modern times refuses to let the film end on an exclusively tragic note and demonstrates that the individual is still alive and may yet find his way in an ever-changing world."
film has become a medium that is strongly influenced by nostalgia.  old films have become journeys to the past; ways to visit times and people that no longer are.  since film is an art that is based on the innovation of previous works  it has an element of nostalgia in its foundation.  we look on the old to find what elements should make up the new.  in city lights  and other silent works of film  a passion emerges that is uniquely honest and sincere.  while watching the film  i was impressed that chaplin really did love the story  the sets  the crew; the whole project.  while this may not have been the complete reality  it felt that way  and thus made the film more enjoyable.  in silent films the audience is forced to be completely reliable on the visual elements of the film; there are no elaborate sound effects or dialogue to provoke an emotional response.since film is at its very core a visual medium  i find silent films to be the basic form of the medium.  i don't use the word basic here in a demeaning sense  but i compare the beauty of silent films to the beauty of early european art  before the concept of perspective was developed in the renaissance.  many books and tomes featured people as tall as the castles they stood in; these works of art were not technologically advanced  but they were  and are  beautiful.  the same example is found when comparing early darreographs of wild animals to contemporary photographs found in national geographic. there is a warmth found in city lights  and other chaplin films (the kid  modern times) that would be lost in the sea of cinematic technology that floods films today.  maybe it's just that with simplicity comes honesty  and honesty is perhaps the most powerful emotion that can cross through the screen and be felt by the viewer.
if there is one charlie chaplin film to recommend  as others have pointed to in the past  city lights is the one. though chaplin played his tramp character superbly in other movies  like modern times and the gold rush  city lights displays the tramp at his funniest  his bravest  his most romantic  and his most sympathetic. it's tough for filmmakers in recent days to bring the audience so close emotionally with the characters  but it's pulled off. the film centers on three characters- the tramp  the quintessential  funny homeless man who blends into the crowd  but gets caught in predicaments. he helps a drunken businessman (myers  a fine performance in his own right) from suicide  and becomes his on and off again friend (that is  when it suits him and doesn't notice his 'friend's' state). the other person in the tramp's life is the blind flower girl (virginia cherrill  one of the most absorbing  beautiful  and key female performances in silent film)  who are quite fond of each other despite the lack of total perception. the emotional centerpiece comes in obtaining rent and eye surgery money  which leads to a (how else can i put it) magical boxing match where it's basically a 180 from the brutality and viscerality of a match in say raging bull. though there is no dialog  the film achieves a timelessness- it's essentially a tale of two loners who find each other  lose each other  and find each other again (the last scene  widely discussed by critics for decades  is moving if not tear-inducing). and it's never  ever boring- once you get along with the tramp  you find the little things about him  the reaction shots  the little things he does after the usual big gag (look to the ballroom scene for examples of this  or when he gets a bottle of wine poured down his pants without the other guy noticing). truth be told  if this film makes you indifferent  never watch chaplin again. but if you give yourself to the film  you may find it's one of the most charming from the era  or perhaps any era.
this movie was almost unwatchable for me at time because of its heartbreaking depiction of life on the streets of a big city. the scenes with the 12 year pulling around the infant in a big pot as he sought to provide for them both made me cry. there's so much pain in the world!
"capharnaum - the movienadine labaki always astonishes me with her work and this is actually my first time ever to write a review about a movie. but this... this is a masterpiece...capharnaum managed to stir my emotions  it awakened my mind to things we see on a daily basis but decide to ignore. it was a big slap in the face  to be honest. as i watched  i hated myself for having food and shelter. i hated the fact that i paid 14.000 lbps for my own pleasure and enjoyment to watch a movie. i hated the fact that i bought a $1 worth of pop corn for $7. why do i get to enjoy a three-hour movie whilst others need that money for a three-day food supply? for those who still haven't seen it  it's a story of a supposedly 12-year old boy who gets sued for stabbing a ""son of a bitch"" (as the boy  zain describes him). it depicts the life of a typical lebanese poor family  only if the word poor was enough. it portrays how they eat  how they dress  how they talk and behave and what they do for a living. it was so real that i thought it was actual footage from zain's life. the movie also displays the life of an ethiopian woman who has no permit and who was knocked up by some guy and gave birth to a baby she can barely support. oh  speaking of the ethiopian woman; i was meaning to mention  as soon as the movie starts  we see zain at court and then we also see the ethiopian  tegist with tears in her eyes while waiting for internal security to call out her name. at this point i'm really curious as of what this is going to be about and some guy behind me makes a ""funny"" joke about the scene saying ""oh  so the ethiopian is the star of the movie?""... i don't know why but i thought i'd mention that because it left me in shock... we'll get back to that later. capharnaum addresses poverty  illiteracy  ignorance  cruelty  racism  unawareness and child abuse. on the other hand  it also addresses kindness  innocence  forgiveness and faith. it is just amazing how zain worked so damn hard to support tigest's baby all alone while his parents didn't have a care in the world for their own children. a 12-year old boy taking care of a baby was just so heartwarming and beautiful. 
zain's personality is amazingly complex and in him one can touch awareness and illiteracy at the same time. innocence and violence. politeness and insensitivity. good and bad. love and hate. 
he had a vision  he had a message. 
his message was bigger than governments and countries. it was bigger than you and me. it was a message that we decide to laugh about instead of help spread. the message is simplified in one word: awareness.about the guy i mentioned earlier  lets hope he has learned something from the movie...lets make this movie our prayer before going to bed every night... then  we could try and change the world to the better.nadine labaki keeps on dazzling us with her great work... i can't wait for the next one. we  as lebanese  are so proud of you. and the whole world should be. much love."
this anime is just superb. it is one of those moments when a rare absorbing story  beautiful locale and art come together. it deserves all the praise it is receiving.with success comes cash hounds and mercenaries of course. worst of them all is jj abrams from hollywood. he has been given the task of remaking kimi no na wa. oh no! the feeling will disappear  the underlying sense of humanity will disappear  the story will be set in (i am guessing) dallas texas or some similar dump  the girl will be wearing long prairie skirt like a good jewish girl and we will all ask why didn't hollywood learn a lesson from the american remake of ghost in the shell which was a mess?sigh. it makes me depressed that money is so important in this world.
in a world dominated by stupid sequels  prequels and remakes it is film/anime like this that restores hope in today's entertainment.not only it is emotional and feels real  it delivers a relevant message. i love the imagination and palette but also appreciate that it aims to remind us of social issues that we should be paying attention to.the only reason i don't give our heroes and their story a 10/10 is that i still feel a couple of miyazaki movies (like kiki  chihiro and the racoon dogs) were just that much better and showed a little more imagination.whatever the case i live in fear of the hollywood announced remake by hollywood hack jj abrams who has never shown any talent or vision. as with others i will ignore and boycott that coming insult and always cherish kimi no na wa.

if i would i've seen this movie in 2016  it certainly would have been in my list of best movies. if you're going to this movie thinking aamir will be flexing and showcasing his acting prowess then well and good but the girls are the highlight of the movie  hands down. script - major props to bringing out a story which is inspiring and one which india needs right now. the story is kept grounded in reality. no over-the-top gimmicks. the songs blend in very well with the premise. none of the scenes linger on for a long period of time. there was a very natural flow to the story which helped engage the audience for 2 hours and 41 minutes. even movies like mary kom or bhaag milkha bhaag started to drag by the end but hats off to piyush gupta and shreyas jain. i have said this that dialogue shouldn't seem like dialogue unless it is a musical or a re-imagining of a play. the dialogue in this movie is a lesson as to how dialogue should be used. little nods and grunts and expressions serve more than an explanatory conversation. i am not a fan of narration and i wasn't really liking it here either. it was fine for the light-hearted scenes but the serious scenes required silence but i can give it a pass. the only scene which felt a bit off is where mahavir gets locked up in a room before the final fight. if it didn't happen in reality then it was really unnecessary. direction - chillar party was a movie with some serious message but was a little preachy and bhootnath returns went full preachy. nitesh tiwari toned down that preaching to a very natural level in this movie. every single topic that has happened or still happens in a family was touched upon. beginning from the sleaziness of men to child-marriage to the sacrifice parents make  everything was utilised to the advantage of the movie. none of that brought the movie to a halt. the first half of the movie had a good amount of comedy and that gelled into the second half with ease. the thing that many might not notice that there are no pay-off scenes except for the last scene. if the audience reaches a peak before the ending then the pay-off wouldn't have a solid effect  if used multiple times. pay-off scenes are those scenes where the characters are shown to be doing things in extra slow-motion to have an orgasmic effect on the audience and the director cleverly used it at the end in order to give proper tribute to the art and the character. fight choreography - this section needed a category of it's own and quite deservedly. i saw mary kom  sultan and saala khadoos which had extensive fight scenes and all of the movies had extremely lack-lustre fight scenes. the camera moved too much in order to cover up the actor/actresses' incapability to fight. in comparison to all those movies  here the camera just followed the fighters. no wide-shots of the fight from the audience's perspective because that allows the stunt double to come in. all the fights had the actresses in the scene and hats off to all of them for their dedication. acting - like i said before  the best performance among some amazing performances was of the newcomer fatima sana shaikh. that said  it will really be unjust to name one performance as the best performance because everyone was amazing in this movie. aamir khan  sakshi tanwar  sanya malhotra  aparshakti khurana zaira wasim  suhani bhatnagar ritwik shore and girish kulkarni gave amazing performances. as aamir had put on so much weight  that altered his physicality a lot which enhanced his performance to another level. sakshi tanwar should be doing more movies. she gave a very subdued and nuanced performance. sanya malhotra as the grown up babita had very few scenes but her eyes spoke when she didn't have any dialogue. zaira wasim and sulhani bhatnagar were awesome  just awesome. i was in awe how they are able to emote so much at their age. ritwik shore and aparshakti khurana together made omkar a memorable character. i think they had some of the best scenes in the entire movie. i wanted to kill girish kulkarni after ugly and after this i still want to kill him and that's a compliment. the side actors who formed the audience and little roles like the dangal organiser and the guy who had sleazy theatre also gave substance to the movie. final verdict - i am sure everyone has seen this movie by now and if you haven't then please do. it's a complete movie and it is very rare to see a complete movie  without gimmicks nowadays. i loved how they had such eye for detail because they gave that damaged effect to aamir's ear. many wouldn't notice it but it's great to that they did to provide authenticity to the character and the movie. it's a 10/10 for me and one of the best movies of 2016.
"as much as i enjoy this movie (and as an animator/storyartist i love the visuals!) i have to honest and say it is a bit of an unfocused mess. the reason why you should see this movie is because it is the first in what will hopefully be a trend of innovative and creative animated movies that aren't just looking over the shoulders of what disney and pixar are doing. this movie is its own creature and i think it deserves to be seen just for the visuals and the opportunity to hopefully support this trend...however  i would only say that if the movie has some substance to it.... which it does. i recommend people see this movie  but it should be noted that i think this movie may be getting the ""kubo"" treatment where an animated film is visually impressive to such a degree that people gloss over bad writing because everything they are looking at is so cool.the first half of this movie is brilliant. i think just about everything in the first half works really well and is super effective. miles morales felt like a real kid with some real kid issues  peter b parker was funny  tragic and fleshed out  and gwen... existed (we'll get to her later). my eyes were glued to the screen and i was excited for where the story would go as i was genuinely surprised at a couple twists and turns in the story.then  a certain moment happened in the movie where i was taken out of the film and went  ""wait... oh shoot this is going downhill real fast."" it was the introduction of all of the other spider-verse characters. at that moment the film shifted gears into an entirely different film from the first half. does miles morales fit in with the professionals? can miles morales impress them? everyone seems to hate him due to his lack of experience! can miles morales take a leap of faith (which he already did in the beginning of the movie)??!?! is miles morales even relevant to the story?!?!?!?! all of these sudden new themes and plot developments completely derail what the first half of the film was setting up to such a degree that it felt like a giant schism cut through the film and the second half of the film was waving goodbye to the first half.i'll be clear that i have no issue with other spider-verse characters sharing screen-time in the film  the issue is that they don't add much in terms of character development or interaction with miles. the characters should serve to help miles grow  but in this movie they just seem like another pair of fists to punch bad guys  and there is no better example of this than...gwen stacey.gwen stacey has the unfortunate issue of being completely irrelevant to the story when she should be an important and vital character to peter b parker's/miles morales' character growth and should have an arc of her own. this is a character who witnessed peter parker (her best friend) die and peter b parker is someone who witnessed gwen stacey die in her universe! why don't they discuss this!!! peter b parker should be surprised and excited to see someone he knew as dead alive again and she should be happy to see her best friend once more! instead  the two characters just... punch bad guys... like everyone else. no growth or development between the two.to make matters worse  gwen doesn't even really work to help miles morales develop as a character. in the beginning of the film she is built up to be one of the main characters  but in the second half she doesn't develop any further than she did in the beginning. she experiences no character growth nor does she help develop any other characters. she just exists in the film.i could go on for a while about all of the different weird pacing issues in the second half of the film such as miles morales suddenly getting super powerful and skilled out of nowhere (it's odd that people complain about ""mary sues"" in film but don't complain about miles morales going from zero to hero in one scene)  or a single cut from a comedy scene to a tragic ""friends splitting up"" scene  some loose character threads such as miles' dad telling cops to chase spider-man but we never see them do it  and many other instances of odd pacing choices and poor juxtapositions of emotional story beats.but  i will end this on a positive note: all of the characters are enjoyable when they get their moment and i think the writing on the father was really good. he wasn't your typical ""larger than life"" father but a very honest  strong  but stubborn dad who has his flaws yet is very likable and reasonable. i wish him and uncle aaron had some scenes together and their dynamic was a bit more fleshed out  but as is i still like them regardless of the additional scenes they deserved.go see it if you want to support innovative and risky animation  but be warned that it is not a perfect film (other than visually)."
i have to say  and no pun-intended: into the spider-verse is a total marvel  all the way down to its stylish and diverse styles of animation to its bold  sophisticated storytelling. the visuals are absolutely enchanting. fast  colorful  and distinct. something sony animation always nails is how each character has a pronounced look and movement. with the various kinds of spider-men and marvel villains featured in this story  the animators went all out to give them a unique identity. notably in this case are spider-man noir  peni parker  and spider-ham. noir  whose universe takes place in 1930s new york  boasts a dark  shadowy vibe similar to sin city  peni parker has a bubbly anime look  and spider-ham is a bouncy  eccentric cartoon character who takes full advantage of his absurd existence to deliver some of the film's best laughs. even with these different identities  the film slows down to balance their character in a serious nature. heck  one of the most hard-hitting  poignant lines is spoken by spider-ham  the breakout comedic relief.miles and a majority of characters share the same art style. i really enjoy the blend of 3d models with traditional 2d movement. it's very appealing to watch and it seamlessly matches the comic book theme. i also appreciate the stylization of certain villains. kingpin is a character i don't think was portrayed accurately outside of the comics  just appearing as a generic  heavy-set bald brute  when he's really an enormous  borderline non-human tank. kingpin looks excellent in this film  with his titanic body and small head with an intimidating grimace. he's a powerful force and a legitimately scary antagonist. doc ock is another example  portrayed as a brilliant  but outlandish female scientist with a psychotic passion for villainy. i didn't feel like i needed to know more about her character  she was such a fun villainess to watch. she really added to the suspense in some action sequences.i really loved the story. i thought it was rich with charm and thrills. granted  i did notice some familiar elements that are done to death in superhero fiction and the animation canon alike  such as surprise villain reveals and major character deaths that were obviously seen coming  and i certainly wish some characters (espeically miles' uncle) had more screentime  but there's one fact that overshadows these flaws for me: the writing is mature. first of all  it's a sony animation product. if you look at this company's past work  some of it is very soulless with its marketing and panders to its audience with incessant pop culture references and juvenile comedy. into the spider-verse is a welcome departure. passion and integrity was put into this project. the writing is very grounded and treats its audience like people who want to see a genuinely captivating flick. heck  the first third of the film is somewhat slow and nonchalant  almost like an arthouse film. i've never had such a cool  yet off-beat and engaged feeling while watching an animated film on the big screen. nothing was forced  nothing felt out-of-place  nothing took me out of immersion. the tone and pacing is very adult  even when something excessively goofy like spider-ham is on-screen. it's like the marvel cinematic universe. it can be dark and distressing  but lighthearted and amusing. there's a perfect balance and it never sacrifices integrity just to appeal to a niche audience. well...there is that after-credits scene  but it was quite hilarious  so i let it pass.that's the most i can say without spoiling a lot of the film. i want you to see this absolute marvel with your own eyes. to close  into the spider-verse is everything i hoped it would be. this is a game-changer for both superhero filmmaking and animation altogether. sleek  colorful  funny  emotional  frenetic. this film skillfully balances all these elements. there is never a moment that felt forced  it never talks down to the audience. it's a mature and stylish take on the spider-man mythos  and perhaps the best big-screen spidey picture to date with some of the best animated visuals you'll ever see. i didn't have a single issue with this film. i was dazzled and moved throughout. sony animation  if this was your apology for the emoji movie  then apology goddamn accepted. massive bravo!
"such a horrible movie. it never really held my attention  but i hung in there because it received great ratings. but then end i just had to say no more! the women have to come in at the end to do what then men can't?!? every team member is struggling to complete the task  but when all seems lost  the amazing and awesome capt marvel finally jumps in and in one swoop knocks out this big bad ship causing the men so many problems. then  she finds poor peter parker in the fetal position because he is such a useless and helpless man  only to have the ""ball"" picked up by all the women team members so that they can do what the men can't!! get out of here with this trash! what a slap in the face."
"there is no way that i could describe my emotions for this movie. i'm totally speechless. i haven't laughed (even cried) this much in marvel movie or even in any movie. i'm fully on my emotion  there are so many tears of joy and loss. amazing story  the acting is outstanding  epic action  great cgi  the best storytelling ever told in a superhero movie  amazing performance. i love it more than 3000.happiness  sadness  pure joy  excitement... i'm gonna miss this moment in my whole life because let's face it- it's been awhile movies can bring such a big enthusiasm like this.it is such an experience you'll gonna remember it forever. people are clapping  laughing  crying  full of a state emotion. it's 3 hours long but it went by like a finger snapping by thanos  and now i'm thinking i'm actually in quantum realm because it felt like 5 seconds. even though you know where the story is gonna bring you because it's still a 'superhero movie' but it left me speechless. it's not just a superhero movie  it's more than that.**spoiler alert**even some characters that you didn't like before  you will love them in this movie. like captain marvel. i didn't like her before in her own movie but in endgame they showed how powerful  how strong and how capable she really is. and now i kinda love her! but marvel should really be careful of her line though  i didn't like some of her line like ""i'm the strongest"" and ""you didn't win because before you didn't have me"" duh. also not gonna forget hawkeye. to be honest  in avengers i really didn't like hawkeye because he's just a 'guy' with an arrow and just randomly showed up in any scene but actually he's character is so badass! everything that we need  what we want is here.also i don't get it why some people can not accept that thor is fat or treat him like a joke. i mean  this movie might be trying to give us a message about no matter what 'shape' are you  you can be a hero and save the world. to be honest  i like what they did to thor  that man is depressed and taking the most responsible after he missed the shot to kill thanos in infinity war. even though he already did killed him but it's not gonna bring back his people of asgard. also he's god of thunder for god sake  he could slap his stomach with thunder and got his abs back.i'm so happy too for captain america. finally he could do his dance with peggy and i didn't expected that we could see the fight between captain america with his own self. also when tony met his father really warm my heart  and we can see the 'real-life' jarvis - i didn't expected that too.when the whole superhero arrived it is so epic! the whole person in theater are screaming and shocked. gives me a goosebumps and still left me speechless!this movie is absolute perfection. the ending of this movie is we and the characters deserved. it gives a perfect balance for all these past 10 years. epic and perfect ending  i was not disappointed at all. this movie was completely emotional and visually stunning. now i get it why the russo brothers told us to do a marvel movie marathon before watching endgame because this movie had everything to accomplish what left behind before all of this.ready or not  whatever it takes.go watch it for yourself."
"in fact  the main character isn't any one of our superheroes at all  but thanos. but the movie isn't told from thanos' point of view. instead  infinity war does an excellent job of explaining why thisbad guy wants to have all of the infinity stones. make no mistake  he's still the enemy. however  infinity war does such a good job that at a few parts you nod alongand say to yourself  ""ok thanos  now i know why you want to do this.""
the biggest surprise about infinity war is how well the movie flows together. at no point is the film at all confusing. weunderstand who is fighting whom  and what the risks and rewards are for each fight. it's not overcrowded  like one
might believe  even with so many heroes involved.
science fiction author douglas adams's once wrote  ""space is big. you just won't believe how vastly  hugely ... big itis. i mean  you may think it's a long way down the road to the chemist's   but that's just peanuts to space."" replace the word""space"" with""avengers: infinity war""  and you have a reasonable idea of the scope of this movie -in terms of cast  complexity  and box office revenue. indeed  it's both big and ambitious."
"..but still 10/10. or 9.5 if its possible.the mcu has been very consistent in their filmmaking and i am happy that infinity war absolutely delivers.
i am happy that it feels like and is a thanos movie  a movie about a giant purple men who is here not because to kill smth but to fullfil his deep inner beliefs which is well written and understandable for the audience.
the level of how well they combined so many important characters in one movie is immeasureable and still have the ability to craft a good story around it.this movie is not perfect. jokes are sometimes heavily missplaced and peter quills occurence with thanos at titan is not well thought out. i wish there would be a better solution.still. 10 years developement of a consistent franchise. and in the end a purple men with a not so empty heart wins. its great."
coco tells the story of young boy named miguel living in mexico (coco is his great grandmother). miguel loves music and must keep his love a secret from his family who has forbidden music of any kind since the days of his great great grandmother. on día de muertos  miguel wants to enter a contest to showcase his musical talent  but his grandmother intervenes  reiterating the family's ban on music. in his hunt for a suitable guitar to play  miguel finds himself in the land of dead  meeting the spirits of those who have passed on. on his adventure he meets his musical hero  much of his deceased family  and a strange man who asks for his help and quickly becomes a close friend. along the way  miguel helps his new friend and his friend helps him understand the true significance of día de muertos. of course  the title character (coco) turns out to play a vital role before the movie is over. when the moment arrives  she delivers something powerful  and it's beautiful. it moved me in a very satisfying way that felt well-earned and authentic  rather than manipulative  the way many movie moments of this sort feel. quick sidebar: when i took spanish in high school  my teachers would occasionally incorporate culture from spanish-speaking countries (usually mexico) into the lessons. in some of these lessons  i learned about día de muertos. sort of. i'm not sure if the lessons were lacking or if i just wasn't paying much attention to them. regardless  i learned more about día de muertos from coco than i did in four years of high school spanish classes. in high school  my understanding of día de muertos was that it was basically a mexican halloween. they raised spirits from the dead and played music or something  as i understood it. it seemed silly to me. after watching coco i realized that the tradition is anything but silly. it's not about the dressing up or the food or the music. it's about family and remembering those that came before us. leave it to pixar to not only entertain me  but also educate me about a rich and wonderful tradition of another culture. bravo!
im mexican and all i can say is thanks you pizax i just saw this movie and i just remembered all my childhood with my grandparents  mexico was represented beautifully the music  the colors. this movie touched me in my soul and i cried a lot  i created an account just to say how good pixar made everything  again gracias pixar por tan hermosa pelicula.
i saw django unchained with the expectation of any tarantino fan. but i left shaking my head in disappointment. this is not a bad film  but i'm not saying it's a good one.the length of the film is one of the main flaws. there are many scenes that do not serve a purpose to its characters and story. which leads to its pacing problem. these irrelevant scenes exist in the film that often slows it down. it is very unbalanced.mostly  it's the characters and performances. many are giving praise to christoph waltz and leonardo dicaprio. waltz  first of all  is in similar territory when he was in inglorious basterds. he and his character served their purpose and waltz was just fine in the role  but nothing to highly praise. dicaprio as calvin candie was nothing worth noting. either its in the performance or the script  i never really invested in him. it's as if tarantino wanted to write a great movie villain and that's what dicaprio took as his only direction. there is a scene where he gets the evil monologue  but it comes very forced with ultimately ends up destroying the character. jamie foxx  first of all  was the right choice for django  but i believe that tarantino did not trust his protagonist. it takes a long while to get invested in him  but at that point  why bother? but  the standout for me was samuel l. jackson. he takes his character stephen is able to go beyond the material that is given. there is fun in his performance which is what the film should be.i am well aware that i will be in the minority  when it comes to disliking the film. how people will try to tell me that there was more to the story than meets the eye  how it's a great revenge tale  how the characters were great and well written etc. but this is not a good quentin tarantino film. the film is too long  with characters that hold the most minimal of interests. i will be really dishearten to see this film receive awards and praise. maybe it's the love of quentin that will jade people. i know it will. but after coming out of a strong year for film  django falls flat.the movie lacks the confidence of character(s) and story in a hyper active world. it loses it's identity somewhere along the line and the little scenes of greatness cannot save it. most of all it does not have the joy of film that often add life to tarantino films.
i only had one thought on my mind for this christmas: see django unchained. quentin tarantino's latest opus  a western set two years before the civil war  concerns a former slave named django (jamie foxx). he is freed by bounty hunter dr. king shultz (christoph waltz) in order to help him with a bounty. quite quickly  shultz takes django under his wing and trains him as his partner. but he made him a promise: that he would rescue his wife from a plantation owned by the ruthless calvin candie (leonardo dicaprio). and rescuing her is not going to be all that easy.what pains me the most about django unchained  as a die-hard tarantino fan  is just how sloppy it all seems. i enjoyed every minute of it  but i could never shake the feeling of how messy and thrown together it all feels. portions of the film feel episodic (the search for the brittle brothers  mentioned heavily in the trailers  begins and ends practically within minutes)  and some scenes just seem to play out just for the fun of it. another scene from the trailers involving a lynch mob with bags covering their faces seems added for comedic purposes  and has no real point of actually existing. more than any of his films before it  django feels like tarantino simply making a movie for sheer pleasure and with no outside motivations or controllers. the film threatens to go totally off the rails at any given moment  and lacks any real sense of direction or focus. it may sound ridiculous  but the loss of editor sally menke confirms a sneaking suspicion i always had about tarantino – he needed a steady right hand to help encourage him as to what was needed and what was not. i do not want to criticize django's editor fred raskin  but it is obvious he is no menke and that works against the film heavily. it lacks the polish we have come to expect  and is practically stripped of the glossy/cool texture so prevalent in tarantino's work up until now.but then maybe that was his intention all along  and perhaps tarantino is airing out his frustrations with life and film in general. django is deliberately shot on film (or at least from the print i saw)  and looks very gritty and messy at all times. it is significantly more brutally violent than anything he has worked on before (the borderline cartoonish kill bill included)  and has a very go for broke attitude about itself. the film seems to revel in how brilliantly it can splatter all the blood and gore (done through the use of squibs and no digital!)  and how uncomfortably numbing it can make the violence. i know he does not care what people think of his films  but this movie especially seems like an emphatically raised middle finger to the establishment. and for all of my complaints about how messy it all feels  i was never once bored or felt like the movie was dragging itself out. the staggering 165-minute running time shockingly flies by faster than you might ever imagine.acting wise  tarantino stacks the deck with a number of recognizable character actors young and old for roles that vary in size. most have very few lines  if any at all  and seem to just stand by  just as content as the audience is to watch the action unfold. it is a little off-putting  especially with how important some of these characters are initially made out to be. washington as broomhilda von shaft (one of the most subtle references he's ever dropped) does well as the helpless victim and frequent dreamlike object – but she never really gets to show off any of her acting prowess outside of her facial reactions. they are increasingly effective  especially during horrific flashback scenes. but her work here feels ridiculously stunted in comparison to the other leads. samuel l. jackson  much like tarantino himself  seems to just be having fun in his role as candie's adviser stephen. he plays on every ridiculous stereotype he ever has been associated with and then amps it up to a near ludicrous state. he is frequently hilarious  but the role seems to border on parody more than anything else.surprisingly  foxx takes a very long time settling into the leading role. it may just be the character  but it is quite clear from the on- set that he is not very comfortable in django's shoes  and leads credence to why will smith  amongst so many others  dropped out of the picture so quickly. but once he finds his footing  he does a fantastic job walking the thin line between empathetic and sadistic. it is not an easy character to play  but foxx makes it his own  bringing a sense of style and grace that are virtually absent from the rest of the film. and of course  he gets all the best lines.waltz and dicaprio are the clear standouts however  nailing every nuance of their sadly underwritten characters. while waltz plays the straight man  dicaprio is delightfully unhinged and vicious. both are playing directly against type  yet are strangely comfortable in the roles. watching them act circles around the rest of the cast  foxx included  is the true highlight of the film. i just wish they were both given additional emphasis and more to do. for all of its numerous faults  i had a blast watching django unchained. it is hilarious  it is a lot of fun  and is wildly enjoyable. i genuinely think it could have been a lot better if there was more focus and direction  but this is very clearly a picture tarantino wanted to make on his own terms. and for that  i applaud him for the effort. it is not his best work  but certainly not his worst. 8/10.
"what makes things worse  is that its predecessors were basically intricate works of genius  but tdkr lacks essentially everything that made the dark knight (particularly) one of the greatest superhero movies ever produced. on top of all this  everyone's bandwagoning on thinking it's great because it's ""supposed"" to be great  right?!?! how could nolan's finale not be a masterpiece?! well  i'll tell you...bruce wayne acts out-of-character from not just the first two movies  but from the comic as well. catwoman's motivation and place in the story is weak  flat  and forced. for a movie that's almost three hours long  you only get about 20 minutes of batman in costume (if you're lucky). the movie jumps in weird time increments that are mildly confusing  but mostly forced to facilitate its wanna-be epic nature. as for more heavily spoilery observations...commissioner gordon is barely in the movie  spending most his time injured in a hospital  while joseph gordon-levitt's character comes out of the blue and does what you'd expect the commissioner to be doing... solution- combine the two characters!!! the two batman vs. bane fights are flat and boring as hell. bane is a cardboard  unexplored (until a late-third act flashback... of all ridiculous cliché plot devices) character that reaches for sympathy in one of the most embarrassing  wanna-be-tender  totally out-of-place  extremely laughable scenes i've ever seen in my life- he friggin' cries?!!?!? every single  yes every single cop in gotham marches down into the sewers on a tip that bane's raising a secret army  only to have all the entrances blown up so they can be trapped down there... for like three months. reread that last sentence and tell me what part of it makes sense.bane holds gotham hostage with a 4 megaton nuclear device  after blowing up all but one bridge leading into and out of the city  for three months and the u.s. government does nothing. seriously  nothing. it's said they negotiated a truce and had fema send in supplies for survival. read that last paragraph and tell me what part of it makes sense.the ""real"" villain reveals him/her self in an absurd act 3 ""twist"" that's followed by a narrated flashback (the same one that leads to bane crying)  and throughout the entire monologue batman sits there doing nothing after a knife has been thrust/held into his side.after the 2nd lame bats/bane fight  the bulk of the late act 3rd ""action sequence"" consists of little more than batman flying around in that weird-looking clunky flying thing that supposed to be the bat plane- half of which is of him outmaneuvering missiles that the bulky ""plane"" couldn't have possibly eluded.i really  really  really  really  really  really wanted to not just like this  but love it  but as it progressed the enthusiasm cloud gradually cleared to the point of my being utterly flabberghasted in disappointment- mostly because i can't believe the director of the dark knight and the masterpiece that is inception was responsible for this movie. it's lazy and uninspired to the point of being offensive to everyone who's ever been not just a batman fan  but a fan of non- intelligence-insulting movies."
christopher nolan's epic trilogy concludes in glorious fashion and gives us a thought provoking and suitably satisfying conclusion to an epic saga. it's emotional  intense and has a great villain in tom hardy.
rajkumar hirani... the name is enough to create an excitement in any cinema-fan alive. munnabhai series have been awesome films  and his latest offering '3 idiots' is another masterstroke from this genius.i have no idea how 5-point-someone is  all i know is that '3 idiots' is an amazing/awesome/inspiring film. a treat of a film! a film that is rich in emotions  a film that leaves behind a great moral. the youth are sure to worship this film  and that will make this film a blockbuster. cancel anything you're planning to do till the 31st  watch '3 idiots'  it's worth your time and money. hirani and joshi's script is simply superb. through humor how many rights and wrongs are said. i really loved the way hirani showed us sharman's family. a typical 1950's family  it's hilarious as well as genius.the film has superb performances: aamir is fantastic as funsok wang do. he's a delight every time he appears on screen and delivers his careers finest work. maddy excels  he's astounding in the sequence when he shares his heart with his father. sharman joshi is good  yet again. omi is a masterstroke. a surprise packet  his speech sequence is sure to be remembered forever! kareena is weak. boman irani is mind-blowing as the vicious head. he leaves you speechless in the scene when he awards aamir the pen. mona is average.the music is decent  with 'all izz well' being a complete chart-buster. the cinematography is perfect. all other departments are satisfactory.watch this film right now...
"it's hard for me to review this film  as i have not seen a huge number of indian films--probably no more than a couple dozen. most of the ones i've seen were wonderfully entertaining but i am far from an expert on bollywood. because of this  i have a hard time knowing how good this film is relative to other films from this country. so  consider this when you read this review. this may be among the very best india has to offer or it just seems that way to me.like so many indian films  this is a very  very long film--with a run-time of almost three hours. when a movie is bad or just okay  this can seem like forever  but since ""3 idiots"" is a very  very good film i loved its length. and  like most films of the genre  it has its share of the usual singing and dancing so foreign to films from other countries. one thing you should know  however  is that defining the type of film it is isn't really easy. much of it is a comedy  but it also has many poignant moments (keep the kleenex nearby)  some existential moments where they explore the meaning of life and work and it's also a tender film about friendship. and  as my daughter pointed out when she saw the film  she loved that the men in the movie are not afraid to cry--something you rarely see in western films.as for the plot  it's very long and involved and i could recount what occurs. but i don't want to spoil a single wonderful moment  so my advice is just sit back and watch--and if you give it a chance  i can almost guarantee you'll have a great time with this poignant and funny film. wonderful and well worth your time--with a delightful script  wonderful characters and lots of moments that made me smile...and a few that brought me to tears. see this film."
"how many times has there been a movie you could really relate to? how many times has it happened that you've seen a character on the screen that reminds of something that you've been through in your life? as i saw ishan (darsheel safary) today  i felt  somewhere deep within that that's me.notwithstanding the slight retard nature  dyslexia and bad academic performance  the character of ishan really made me remember my childhood today. i remember i was something like him as a child.creative and imaginative. and my imagination always went unappreciated. i used to curate gibberish  just like he did. i painted  i dreamed and i fantasized about different things. so i feel writer amol gupte and director aamir khan (what a wonderful debut!) have picked an incredibly moving story. frankly  i am not easily moved by movies. not even the greatest tearjerkers have managed to ""move"" me  but for a moment i was stunned. is this really happening to me? am i trying to cry? in fact  the scene where ram (aamir khan) walks into ishan's room and discovers a score of sketches and drawings  it made me feel like somebody had in fact  opened my closet and discovered my secret childhood fantasies (believe me  i still have them.) this movie will surely engage all those who have had similar incidents in their lives. that's for sure. i am moved. i love this film. i don't know and i don't care how this film does in the box office but let me tell you don't watch this film if you're looking for regular boy meets girl story. don't even skip this film thinking it's children's movie  no it isn't. in fact  taare zameen par is a movie potentially targeted towards parents. but if you think you too have undergone similar childhood conflicts and lived a life where the people around you refuse to appreciate your fantasies  then definitely go for it. tzp mirrors many of those people's lives that looks just plain and simple but those who compromised their dreams for the sake of the earthly existence.okay  enough of fantasies. technically  writer amol gupte delivers an a grade script. aamir khan shows his talent not just as an actor but a very versatile and intelligent. oscar wilde  leonardo da vinci and sally gardner were hardly ever heard of in hindi cinema before this. the writer just does not deliver a well written script but also his knowledge of research (which other filmmakers hardly ever do!) musically  it's two-thumbs up for shanker ehsaan loy. the title song is fascinating. maa and jame raho combine talents in all respects- music  words and voice. the production design is superb. not for a moment you feel anything is fake. they even managed to squeeze in some quick visual effects and animated scenes. they're there to add another dimension to great story telling. the casting is good and well justified. little darsheel steals the show. tisca chopra grabs attention.aamir khan  however stuns the audience by appearing at almost near half of the film. that's the surprise but you don't miss aamir in the first half because darsheel will definitely grab your attention and aamir gets to show some good directorial talent.all in all  i'd say go and watch the film. i wouldn't recommend if you're addicted to yashraj stuffs but if you really want to see some intelligent film-making  then taare zameen par is a treat."
"the film brings to light what it is truly like to be dyslexic. aamir khan succeeded in creating the awareness about dyslexia thru this film.
sometimes we really need to step into the shoes of kids and see the world thru their point of view.
the irony is that we all were kids  we all went thru the pressure of performing in sports n studies but yet we push our kids  especially in india n china.the child actor is amazing  aamir stole the show  the music is great  the pacing is very good n the film's script is one of the best to come out from bollywood."
i can't say enough about how good this movie  that you probably haven't read  so i'm going to keep this short.this is the best thing out there in theater's right now  and might just be the best animated film of all time  whether you believe that or not  is your own opinion  but what pixar has done here  can put companies like dreamworks  sony  and blue sky to shame.wall e also may go down as the most lovable character ever to grace the movie screen  i praise ben burtt and andrew stanton  and the people at pixar for what they did  and will continue to do.this is why pixar is the top studio in the world.10/10
"who says popular films are not and cannot be art? if anything is proof that popular films can be of a stunningly high quality  the beauty of the animation  writing  music  and sound design in ""wall·e"" is it. ""wall·e"" eclipses even andrew stanton's ""toy story"" and ""toy story 2"" in the pixar pantheon  is perhaps pixar's best film to date and  call me crazy as i've just seen it  a contender for the title of best animated film  period.""wall·e"" is everything we've come to expect from pixar and more- colorful  vibrant  imaginative  exciting  involving  beautiful  and most importantly a film with interesting  involving characters. sure  wall·e is adorable  and as much credit as the animators get for that  this film would be nothing without stanton's screenplay  which features very little dialogue but is still notably intelligent and surprisingly subtle  making a refreshing change from the 'go green' campaigns we're all so used to. does ""wall·e"" have a message? sure  but it's an important message and it is delivered subtly and beautifully.""wall·e"" operates on two levels (and works spectacularly well on both). it is a majestic science fiction epic like we haven't seen in a couple of decades and it is a genuinely touching and never cheap romance. ""wall·e"" will never get points for originality but it doesn't exactly need them because the homages to great films and figures of the past- chaplin  keaton  tati  the marx brothers  ""2001: a space odyssey"" (this one is particularly spectacular)  ""close encounters of the third kind"" are actually homages and not ripoffs. ""wall·e"" is a wonderful tribute to a bygone cinematic tradition (well  two or three of them actually). the social commentary in ""wall·e"" is sobering because it's never overbearing and most importantly because we see the world through machines  machines who feel more about earth and life than the humans do. the depiction of humans on the ship could have been incredibly offensive  cheap  and tasteless in concept but the execution here is absolutely perfect.what is most surprising about ""wall·e"" is how sad it is. not even in the 'how will they get out of this  oh i feel so sorry for them' way ""finding nemo""  a previous stanton effort  is  but in a truly melancholy sense. the early portion of the film maintains all the playfulness of a jacques tati film but also evokes a striking and powerful feeling of loneliness. it's a brilliant introduction to wall·e  given that the rest of the film is too wacky to bother with long scenes focused entirely on character  and works beautifully with the ugly yet beautifully-rendered future earth  a barren wasteland filled with nothing but garbage  a seriously resilient cockroach being wall·e's only companion before eve shows up  but i won't go into the story- it's best you see it unfold for yourself.from the entertaining shorts shown before the film to the memorable characters  locations  and animation we have come to expect  pixar films are now event cinema  and they have outdone themselves with ""wall·e"". this film is spectacular  majestic  touching  involving  and achingly beautiful. most importantly  however  it is perfect entertainment. i may be saying this too soon  but i don't think i have ever seen an animated film that has satisfied me more than ""wall·e""  and 2008 is going to have to work hard to keep this from being the top film of the year  which it most certainly is at the moment.9.5/10"
i won't go into the plot.the film concerns east germany during the eighties at it's most oppressive.the film is engrossing and so absorbing that i forgot i was reading subtitles all through it.well worth the evening. the lives of others is what film is supposed to do which is to make one think about one's life and the society one is living in.i should say that the promotional poster is very misleading and i fear it will hurt this outstanding film.those nude couples is absolutely not what this film is about.this is not some film about a group of self-absorbed adults jumping in and out of beds to put some excitement into their dull lives.this is a political film involving adults who are trying to live life freely in a very oppressive environment.the publicists should really re-think their promotional campaign.
"because this movie deals with recent german history  some german comments about it get sidetracked into minute historical discussions. forget them; das leben der anderen is an outstanding movie that should be seen everywhere.the former east germany  a relatively small country of 16 million people  was controlled by the most sophisticated  cunning  and thorough secret police the world has ever seen  the east german ministerium für staatsicherheit  or ""stasi."" the stasi had about 90 000 employees -- a staggering number for such a small population -- but even more importantly  recruited a network of hundreds of thousands of ""unofficial employees "" who submitted secret reports on their co-workers  bosses  friends  neighbors  and even family members. some did so voluntarily  but many were bribed or blackmailed into collaboration.das leben der anderen  (""the life of others"") german director florian henckel von donnersmarck's debut  builds this painful legacy into a fascinating  moving film. in its moral seriousness  artistic refinement  and depth  das leben der anderen simply towers over other recent german movies  and urgently deserves a wide international release. the fulcrum of the movie (but probably not its most important character) is georg dreyman  an up-and-coming east german playwright in his late 30s. played by the square-jawed sebastian koch  dreyman is an (apparently) convinced socialist who's made his peace with the regime. his plays are either ideologically neutral or acceptable  and he's even received state honors.although he is a collaborator  he is also a mensch. he uses his ideological ""cleanliness"" to intervene on behalf of dissidents such as his journalist friend paul hauser (hans-uwe bauer). these unfortunates must contend with every humiliation a totalitarian state can invent: their apartments are bugged  friends and family are recruited to inform on them  and chances to publish or perform can be extinguished by one stray comment from a central committee member. the most recalcitrant can be kicked out of the country and stripped of their citizenship  like the singer songwriter wolf biermann.dreyman lives in a shabby-genteel  book-filled apartment with his girlfriend christa-maria sieland (martina gedeck)  a renowned actress who often appears in his plays. at the beginning of the movie  dreyman himself comes under the regime's suspicion  for reasons that become clear only later. the fearful machinery of the stasi rumbles to life: his movements are recorded  and his apartment bugged. the stasi had bugging down to a science: a team of meticulously-trained agents swoop into your apartment when you're not there  install miniscule  undetectable listening devices in every single room -- including the bathroom -- and vanish in less than an hour  leaving no trace. agents set up an secret electronic command post nearby  keeping a written record of every joke  argument  or lovemaking session.the ""operative process"" against dreyman is overseen by stasi captain gerd wiesler  played by ulrich mühe  an actor from the former east who was himself once in the stasi's cross-hairs. captain wiesler starts the film as a colorless  icy  tight-lipped professional who shows no mercy in fighting the ""enemies of socialism"": if he needs to interrogate a suspect for 10 hours without sleep to get a confession  he will do so -- and then place the seat-cover the suspect sat on in a vacuum jar in case the miscreant should later need to be tracked by bloodhounds. at night  captain wiesler returns to his tiny apartment in an grubby  anonymous high-rise. he settles himself among his inexpressibly drab furniture  eats a meal squeezed out of a plastic tube while watching reports about agricultural production  and then goes to bed alone.as captain wiesler listens to dreyman and his girlfriend he begins to like them  or perhaps envy the richness and depth of their lives in comparison with his own. perhaps he also begins to wonder why a stranger should have the right to become privy to dreyman's most intimate secrets: his occasional impotence  his girlfriend's infidelities  his artistic crises. at the same time  though  wiesler is under pressure: a central committee official has made it clear to wiesler and his toadying supervisor lieutenant colonel grubitz (ulrich tukur)  that dreyman has to go down. i won't discuss more plot details  as there are unexpected twists. each of the main characters is drawn deeper into the conflict between dreyman and the state  and each is torqued by loyalty conflicts that intensify as the pressure increases. the cast is outstanding. sebastian koch finds the right combination of poetic detachment and watchful sophistication for dreyman. martina gedeck  as his girlfriend  has the most challenging role  since she's buffeted from all sides: by her suspicious partner  by stasi agents trying to turn her  and by a lecherous culture minister. ulrich mühe plays the stasi agent's transformation with reserve  only hinting at the stages in his character's secret  but decisive  change of heart.director von donnersmarck  a blue-blooded west german  has re-created the gray  drained look of the former east  and the nature of stasi intimidation  with a fidelity that has earned the praise of east germans. his pacing is relaxed  but doesn't drag; although there are a few longueurs  most scenes unfold at just the right pace  and there are several great set-pieces. one is a bone-rattling episode in the stasi canteen in which a young recruit is caught telling a joke about east german premier erich honecker. another is the penultimate scene  a masterstroke in which dreyman gains access to his massive stasi file  while reading it  suddenly understands episodes of his own life which had never made sense to him before. the ending is perfectly judged; bittersweet and moving without swelling strings or teary confessions.das leben der anderen is an outstanding movie  probably a great one. if it's not picked up for international distribution  it will be a bitter loss for thousands of potential moviegoers in other countries."
oldboy is one of the most intense movies you will ever see. breathtaking  brutal and easily one of the best revenge movies ever made. the acting is amazing  especially choi as the main protagonist dae-su oh. all the actors did great but his performance was powerful and emotional (all you need to do is see the infamous squid scene). chan-wook park gives this movie a very unique style with his direction. the plot starts off like a fairly standard revenge drama but he slowly makes the movie darker through a series of beautifully shot flashbacks and a huge scene involving nothing but a family photo album.if you can't handle extremely strong violence  torture  sex and language and can't stand subtitles it's best you stay far away from oldboy....if you can  though  then watch it! it's an incredible movie with some of the best performances  a moving score and a disturbing but unique plot with twist after twist.5/5
to start off; this is the one and only film that kept me quiet for a whole 5 mins after seeing it. i literally couldn't close my mouth  and yet there wasn't any sound coming out of it. oldboy had such an impact on me that words are too little to describe that impact. therefore this film is definitely in my top 3 films ever made. it belongs there because it has a massive ingredient that a lot of films seem to miss out on; a divine plot. even though the acting and screenplay are world class  the plot is really the cherry on the cake.when it comes to screenplay park chan-wook is unique (at least for western standards) in his way of filming. the colours are so vivid and it seems like he wanted every shot to be a piece of art. one tip: if you like the shooting in 'oldboy'  have a look at 'sympathy for lady vengeance'  the third part in park's revenge-trilogy. it's even superior to the camera-work in 'oldboy'. don't  however  expect a story like oldboy's  because you would be very disappointed.when it comes to acting and the music  this film is also one of the better films ever made. the music sticks in your head and every time i put in my oldboy-dvd and the theme-song comes up  i'm just flooded with good memories (even though the plot doesn't have a single reason to be happy about). the characters are also presented very well by the outstanding cast. especially choi min-sik and yu ji-tae set a very convincing performance. i really appreciate this film being respected as it should be  by having a place in the top 250. if  however  it was up to me it would be even higher in the ranking. i don't see why films like 'the usual suspects' or 'memento'  which are fantastic pieces of film-making and which without a doubt deserve a place in the top 250  are higher in the top 250 than 'oldboy'. they serve the same cause; a fantastic plot. but those plots can't stand in the shadow or even come close to the plot of 'oldboy'. the one and only reason is that those two films are better known and from a western production company. if we were all living in asia  no doubt 'oldboy' would be in the top 20 of all time. my advice to people who haven't watched this film yet: go see it! this is definitely a must- see. if you have a weak stomach  pull yourself together and still watch it. don't be as shallow as a lot of people here tend to be. look beyond the violence and see the things i mentioned before: world class acting  cinematography  music and last but certainly not least the plot. once you've opened yourself up you'll find a whole new world of cinema. enjoy!
"if you hate reality-based film-making this is awful. if you hate film noir  this is ugly. but for me  nolan has convinced me he is one of the most important directors out there. i was even thinking  ""it must be easy to edit a movie so that it's all backwards."" but it's not  it's not any easier - and he leaves you straining and watching from scene to scene  searching for the truth. even the final revelation will affect each viewer and leaves them searching for their own ""ultimate truth"" according to their own experience.most people comment about manipulation in connection with this movie  but after watching the last scene  i'm convinced that manipulation is not the main theme at all. i don't want to spoil it for you  but the basis of unfolding backwards in time is that you are enlisted to scrutinize the film trying to discover some set of motivations behind each character's actions later in time that makes sense. if you think you would enjoy this sort of puzzle  i think you will enjoy this excellently crafted film."
thank goodness i didn't read the reviews posted before i saw the film!! most reviews (including ones on this site) will tell you waaayyyy too much about the movie  and that's just plain frustrating.  but  as an avid cinephile  i promise not to do the same.memento is one of those pictures that will have you sitting in the theater after the lights come up so you can talk to everyone else about what they thought of the movie.  this is a highly intelligent and original brain teaser that will have you guessing from beginning to end  and even afterwards.  the story and the direction are the best i've seen so far this year  and it deserves all the kudos it gets.plainly put  the film tells the story of leonard shelby:  a man who lost his short term memory in an assault where his wife was raped and murdered;  now he's looking for the killer  despite his handicap.  simple as that.  you don't need to know anymore.the film is constructed and told in such a way that you are constantly put into the shoes of leonard shelby  beautifully played by guy pierce. carrie-ann moss gives an equally mysterious and complex performance.  this film is well-made all the way around--from the direction  to the editing  and especially the unique story that is rarely found in hollywood these days.  four stars!this review may have been a little dry on the details  but go see the movie--you'll be thanking me later.ps: only go to the official website after you've seen the movie.  it too will give too much away.  afterwards  though  go and look at it--it's pretty impressive.
i'm not a huge fan of anime  so i'm not the best person to review this film. nonetheless i found myself watching it to find out what all the fuss was about.initially  i found the film gripping. the old-fashioned animation felt fresh and i loved watching the colourful panoramas play out on screen. the early scenes involving the terrible forest monster chasing the film's hero were vivid and exciting; then princess mononoke is introduced.gradually  i lost interest in the film. i found the story far too slim to support the lengthy running time. myriad characters are introduced and underdeveloped  and the emphasis seems to be on repetitive action involving the different factions battling each other. certain sequences are certainly captivating on the animation front - especially the huge  translucent forest god creature - but the story just didn't keep my attention.
"this seems to be miyazake's most personal work  clearly a serious design. it is set in an imaginary time which blends the time of the ancient gods (shinto style  gods of place and nature) with the settlement of humans and the coming of metalworking and war.  the world is not in balance  and a distant conflict between industry and nature has wounded one of the gods of the forest  which is then killed by a sentry boy as it rampages into farmland he guards.  the evil controlling it transfers to him  beginning a slow takeover  and he must journey to the origin of the conflict to find a way to cure himself and incidentally  as he will learn  to try to restore balance.  but this is not a simplistic tale  he finds there are other characters in play  and there is good and evil in everyone  and no easy balance.  the princess (hime) of the story is a mysterious human who has been raised by wolves (which are themselves powerful forest gods  a little reminiscent of the amerindian coyote myth)  who becomes both his ally and his enemy.  the story is not easy to understand.  it has many japanese mythic elements but even then  it is a work of miyazake's unique imagination  and is not intended to be simple or to have a clean resolution.the animation is spectacular  and unusual  with new elements even for miyazake and marks a new departure for style which you can see continued in his next film  sen to chihiro - more nature  more wild  more jamming on elements from japanese myth and folklore.  and  continuing the trend to be more personal  concerned with ethics and character  and less sci-fi. there are at least half a dozen well developed characters threaded through the story  and their animation is wonderful in displaying subtle character.the original japanese soundtrack has some amazing singing and draws upon some of the best talent available for voices - in japan  miyazake is universally known and this was a masterpiece carefully crafted.  japanese television documented a lot of the production.  the english translation drew on some good talent but they seem not to have ""gotten it"" quite so intensely as the japanese crew.if you haven't seen miyazake  give it a try (but maybe look at sen to chihiro first  or even laputa or kiki's delivery service  for easier and lighter introduction to his work).  some say he is the japanese disney  but i don't like that.  his work has a depth and sophistication that goes beyond disney cute.  there is no other animation like it.  this is truly an adult work: children might like some of the visuals  but i doubt that many kids below teen age will have any idea what it is all about  and even adults will get more out of this each time you see it again."
"a smoky is boinking the local teen prostitute  a nubile teen girl undresses  a woman loves the man who gives her rough sex and.... still the film was boring.
unbelievable? the rest of the film is that looooooooooong and boooooooooooooring."
"many people compare ""once upon a time in america"" with ""the godfather"". in my opinion these two movies can't be compared. both are masterpieces in their own way  but each of them has a different style. you don't compare a picasso to michelangelo's sixteen chapel either  do you?what is it that makes this movie a masterpiece? well  first of all there is the director. sergio leone is a real master when it comes to creating a special atmosphere  full of mystery  surprises and drama... he's one of the few directors who understands the art of cutting a movie in such a way that you stay focused until the end. the way the movie was cut is also the reason why a lot of americans don't think this movie is very special. there are three versions  but only the european version is how the director imagined it to be. he didn't want his movie to be shown in chronological order (1910's - 1930's - 1960's)  but wanted to mix these three periods of time. the studio cut the movie in chronological order  loosing a lot of its originality and therefor getting a lot of bad critics. if you want to see this film the way sergio leone saw it  you have to make sure you get the director's cut. the second reason why this movie is so great is the music. ennio morricone  who is seen as the greatest writer of film music ever  did an excellent job. together with the images  the music speaks for itself in this movie. from time to time there isn't said a word  but the music and the images on their own tell the story. he understood perfectly what sergio leone wanted and composed most of the music even before the movie was shot.last but not least there is also the acting and the script. the actors all did an excellent job. but what else can you expect from actors like robert de niro  joe pesci... they helped making this movie as great as it is by putting there best effort in it. the script helped them with it. it took twelve years to complete  but it hasn't left any detail untouched. the writers really thought of everything when creating it.i can really recommend this movie to everyone  but especially to people who like the gangster genre. when you want to see the movie  you better be sure that you will have the time for it. this isn't a movie that is finished after 90 minutes. you'll have to be able to stay focused during 3 hours and 47 minutes  which will certainly not be easy during the first 20 to 30 minutes. some scenes at the beginning only make sense when you have seen the end of the movie. but when you are able to stay focused  you'll find this one of the best movies you've ever seen. i certainly did and i rewarded it with a well deserved 10/10."
it's the first part of adventures trilogy   going on the way of the 30s classic films and the comics-books language. the picture blends comedy adventures action rip roaring cliff hunger tongue-in-cheek and is extremely entertaining and fun . the archaeologist indiana jones with his bull whip-wielding and hat will confront dastard nazis (ronald lacey) in peru  nepal and egypt to the obtaining the moiseh ark with the covenant's tables . he's only helped by two feisty adventurers (karen allen and john rhys davies) . indy fights nasty arabs   decodes hieroglyphics and faces off hundreds of snakes . the movie attempts to go on the path from great classics during the 30-40s and the comic-books narrative along with the special characteristics of the terror cinema of 80 decade.dr.indiana executes feats of derring-do in various exotics countries. the action highlights include the opening sequence in a peruvian jungle temple and the creepy and spooky final  but some scenes aren't for squeamish kids . it's realized in james bond style and high-adventure and it is driven with enormous   formidable fair-play . this breathtaking movie has a number of scenes that will have you on the edge of your seat  but the action never lets up . the enjoyable screenplay was wonderfully written by george lucas (film's producer)   philip kauffman and lawrence kasdan . in the picture there're several exotic locations   cliff-hangers  tongue-in-cheek   daring escapes   rip-roaring   derring-do   it is a very bemusing cinematic roller-coaster ride . it's a throw-back to old-fashioned technicolor amusement with hints of serial with thousands of dollars in budget .harrison ford interprets masterfully the daredevil and brave archaeologist transformed into an action man . karen allen plays his untameable and impulsive couple who'll have a little romance with indy . the movie has great loads of action   special effects galore and the habitual and excellent   as always   john williams musical core . dazzling action set-pieces are stunningly mounted by steven spielberg . the film has entered the lists of ten most popular of all time . it is followed by ¨indiana jones and the temple of doom¨ and¨ the last crusade¨. and by the tv series  also produced by george lucas : ¨the young indiana jones¨with sean patrick flannery .it's a must see for the adventures fans . rating : awesome.
this movie has it all  action  romance  comedy  giant boulders and occult seeking nazis. story conceived by george lucas and screenplay written by the same guy that wrote empire strikes back and return of the jedi. if that doesn't sell it  then look no further than steven spielberg because he directed it. awesome movie all around and definitely a genre classic. an absolute must see for any movie fan that likes fun.
sometimes all good horror needs is a good idea. but sometimes  rarely indeed  a horror masterpiece will reach us by the hand of a kubrick  with the adept  elusive touch of a great artist to guide the vision  and we know what separates it from all else.okay  the story has enough promise that even a hired gun would have to try to fail. heck  even stephen king himself didn't fare so bad. it's how kubrick perceives king's universe however  how he fills the frame with it  that renders the shining a feast for the senses.horror that will reach us through the mind and body alike  an assault as it were  tending eventually its pitch to a crescendo  yet curiously not without a delicate lull.kubrick's cinema is  as usually  a sight to behold. we get the adventurous camera that prowls through the lavish corridors of the overlook hotel like it is some kind of mystic labyrinth rife for exploration  linear tracking shots exposing impeccably decorated interiors in symmetric grandeur. the geometrical approach in how kubrick perceives space reminds me very much of japanese directors of some 10 years before. in that what is depicted in the frame  the elements of narrative  is borderline inconsequential to how they all balance and harmonize together.certain images stand out in this. the first shot of jack's typewriter  ominously accompanied by the off-screen thumps of a ball  drums of doom that seem to emanate from the very walls or the typewriter itself  an instrument of doom in itself as is later shown. a red river flowing through the hotel's elevators in a poetry of slow motions. jack hitting the door with the axe  the camera moving along with him  tracking the action as it happens  as though it's the camera piercing through the door and not the axe. the ultra fast zoom in the kid's face violently thrusting us inside his head before we see the two dead girls from his pov. and of course  the epochal bathroom scene.much has been said of jack nicholson's obtrusive overacting. his mad is not entirely successful  because  well  he's jack nicholson. the guy looks half-mad anyway. playing mad turns him into an exaggerated caricature of himself. shelley duvall on the other hand is one of the most inspired casting choices kubrick ever made. coming from a streak of fantastic performances for robert altman in the seventies (3 women  thieves like us  nashville)  she brings to her character the right amounts of swanlike fragility and emotional distress. a delicate  detached thing thrown in with the mad.
stephen king may have said the master director knew nothing about horror  but that simply is not true. that is a too biased opinion for anyone to go on given that he wrote the book  which kubrick based his wonderful film ever so loosely on. and at any rate  faithful or not  kubrick's shining-the best crafted genre film of the 80's- performs it's duty as a fright flick  and then some.there are appropriately no words strong enough to convey the haunting beauty of the visuals showcased throughout the movie  from the drive to the overlook to the final chase in the hedgemaze the movie is a feast for the eyes as it is for the mind. and it is a feast for the mind as the shining is as psychological as horror gets  toying relentlessly  and expertly with your emotions and expectations(some could even say sadistically)  throwing something in that's completely out of left field and never  ever letting you catch your breath between the now classic shocks as the movie speeds toward it's memorable conclusion in the last half hour.kudos are in order for kubrick  a director of the old school style  who builds an eerie atmosphere by exercising total control over the filmic environment  manipulating everything down to the tiniest detail to suit the needs of the picture  yet filming with a coldly detatched  objective eye  as though kubrick were making a documentary about these events. this would account for the dialouge  which-thankfully-is not the typical phoney balloney hollywood banter (kubrick detractors/king purists usually bitch about this the most  having been weaned on the phony nature of 'hollywood talk'  which is usually nothing at all like real talk. many of us speak 'on the nose'  and do not try to convey subtext through use of carefully chosen words that articulate our state of being without being direct.) in this light  shelley duvall must be commended for her performance which is very naturalistic. it does not seem like acting at all. she is not concerned with glamour  nor does she clutter her performance with typical acting chops  but rather she is solely focussed on hitting the emotional highpoints of her character as 'wendy' gradually comes to realize that her husband is a madman. and let's face it folks  how many of us would like a million bucks when placed in a situation like that? who does not look like a blubbering idiot when they are hysterical? that's what i thought  so what did you expect? she was great. to say nothing of the rest of the cast.
"films like ""apocalypse now""  ""the godfather"" and ""the deer hunter"" all have a somewhat similar feel to them. they are all boring as hell  too long and way overrated. in my opinion  they really need pulling down a peg or two. ok  so maybe i just don't get it  and we'll leave it at that. but i see there are plenty of others here who feel exactly the same as i do  thank god. it's very hard to comprehend how films that are regarded as the best appear to me as some of the worst i've ever seen.i honestly don't know what to say. it really was that much of a snooze-fest for me. the only feelings i can describe to you of me watching the film  was boredom and me thinking about cutting the hedges back at the farm i help out on tomorrow morning. i really did just start to think of other things and forgot about the movie i was watching. 2001: a space odyssey? yup  slow  but brilliant and captivating. but this? man  i...i just don't get it. a man sails up a river....all power to you if you like this. but not for me  thank you"
"apocalypse now is not only the best war film ever made but it's also one of the best films of all time as it won the prestigious palme d'or at cannes and it's constantly recognized as a benchmark in cinematic history. based on the novel ""hearts of darkness"" by joseph conrad this film is not so much about the vietnam war  it is about war in general and serves as a deep study into the dark places of the human soul and how war can affect the individual. apocalypse now depicts a timeless story about a universal human struggle  the duality of man  consisting of morality  the savage primordial instinct and what every person chooses to base his actions upon.the film has a simple premise  us army captain benjamin willard (martin sheen) is ordered on a dangerous mission into cambodia through a river  to assassinate a renegade  colonel kurtz (marlon brando)  who has gone insane and set himself up as a god among the local native tribe. it's an accessible premise  allowing for the film to be consumed by even the most casual movie watchers  and yet this film is anything but shallow. it's a journey into madness and hysteria  an observation into the darkness of humanity. i could write a book analyzing this film  there's just so much to talk about. my interpretation is that the river is not only the passage to find kurtz but also the descent into madness and a reflection to the character's inner journey towards evil that is accomplished through the main theme of the movie  dehumanization. the journey through the river is also reminiscent of dante's perilous journey through unspeakable surroundings and horrors. there are three major stops before kurtz and each stop on the river furthers the dehumanization that war has brought  as well as implanting a new type of evil to the characters.the first stop is with lieutenant kilgore. that stop shows that kilgore and his soldiers have been consumed by the love of war after they dehumanized the enemy. their love of war has blinded them so much that they see no negative and can't comprehend the consequences the war will bring. in one scene of the movie  the ""heroic"" marching of the helicopters to lay wrath upon their enemies  captain kilgore uses wagner's ride of the valkyries to pump his soldiers and scare his enemies and like the mythical creatures valkyries  he is the decider of who lives and who dies on the battle. at this stage  although everyone has removed any shred of humanity from the enemy  they still understand the innocent.the second stop is the uso show where we see the loss of morality as well as the dehumanization of the innocent. at this stop we see that a soldier dehumanized everyone aside from himself  becoming very selfish and losing any compassion for anyone but themselves. the soldiers that have passed through this stop would be willing to put anyone at risk for their instant gratification. now as the characters go deeper into the river metaphorically they go deeper into themselves to explore their own evils which are becoming more apparent.
the last stop before kurtz is the do-long bridge and it's at this point that a soldier has gone too far  he's experienced so much trauma and so much evil that he lost grip with his own sanity and thus he dehumanized himself and can't return to a normal state of mind.the final stop on the journey is kurtz  at this point only willard and kurtz have passed the madness stage and they are competing for the heart of darkness  the ultimate evil that we all have the capacity to have. kurtz is in possession of the heart of darkness as he associates evil with strength. bypassing the madness stage he's able to see the world for what it truly is  filled with hypocrites and he decides to bury his hatred and simply act on instinct. willard at the end of the film rises from the river reborn as a new man ready to obtain the heart himself. he kills kurtz and leaves the compound with his heart corrupted. in the end willard has a choice  succumb to evil and stay in the compound having taken kurtz's place as the leader of the savages or abandoning them into their fates...throwing his weapon  he emerges from the bottomless pit he had fallen through the heart of darkness and by saving lance and choosing not to exterminate the tribe  he has completed his personal journey and tested his soul to the very limit. both of them at any point could have just stopped but they didn't  they wanted to explore the depths of their souls and just how much further they could go.the film presents this study of the human psyche through carmine coppola's eerie score  hypnotic images  and some haunting scenes  essentially taking the viewer into the depths of hell. it's here where coppola succeeds the most. his ability to create a living ""hell"" is so amazing  and it perfectly captures the mindset of the soldiers. it provides a commentary on war and religion  making the subtext even vaster. the film is weirdly beautiful and a true picture of the evil and hell from within ourselves.the cinematography by vittorio storaro is phenomenal and it provides a hallucinatory feeling throughout the film's runtime - from the faces of the losing minds covered in endless sweat  and the sight of figures within the shadows to a dark trenched riverbank - everything is captured in a stunning manner  conveying the hellish imagery and still taking the viewer's breath away. coppola's direction transcends itself  the camerawork is at its absolute best when it comes to the use of lighting and shadows  most notable during col. kurtz's first appearance. the troubled production obviously didn't hurt the film at all  and most likely increased the dark quality it portrays. apocalypse now is beautifully haunting  utterly hellish  terrifyingly intelligent  and magnificently wrought  it slowly pushes you into the horror and absurdity of war  but also its meaningfulness and beauty. not only is this one of the best films ever made  it's a psychoanalytical journey into places none of us would dare to venture to on our own. it is francis ford coppola's magnum opus as he sacrificed everything to make it work. rightfully deserving its place as one of the greatest on the cinematic pantheon  immortal for its contribution to cinema  and a truly unforgettable experience  apocalypse now is cinema at its most complete  crystalline and pure."
"in ""alien"" we follow a seven man crew en-route to earth on board the huge space freighter ""nostromo"". the crew is in cryosleep  but the on board computer interrupts the journey when a foreign radio signal is picked up. it originates from an uninhabited planet and the crew lands to investigate. there they make contact with an alien life-form...what makes alien so great is the constant feel of uneasiness. right from the beginning you have a feeling that something is wrong. the crew is not particularly friendly towards each other  and you truly feel all the in-group tension. the ship itself is a huge worn out industrial-style maze of halls and corridors  and it feels more like a prison than a place to live. it is as if not only the alien but also the ship itself is against the humans. the alien itself is the scariest monster in history because it is a ruthless  soul-less parasite completely devoid of any human or civilized traits. the design of the monster is a stroke of genius. sure it has a humanoid form  but it has no facial traits or anything else which could give away emotions or intentions. its actions reveals no weaknesses nor civilized intelligence. the alien is more or less the opposite of everything human and civilized  plus the creature is more well-adapted to the inhumane interior of the ship than the humans who build it. to sum up  you then have a setting where the humans are caught in a web of in-group tensions  an inhospitable ship and the perfect killer which thrives in the ships intestines. you almost get the feel that the humans are the ones who are alienated to each other and to their own ship.ridley scott tells the story with a perfectly synchronized blend of visuals and sounds. the actors do a superb job  portraying their characters in a subtle but very realistic way. the seven man crew is not a bunch of hollywood heroes. they are ordinary people with strengths and weaknesses  likes and dislikes. in this way they all seem so fragile when confronted with the enemy. as mentioned the ship is very claustrophobic and ridley scott adds to the eeriness by using camera movement  lights and shadows in an effective way. the living quarters are bright and should be comfortable to the crew  but there is something sterile about it all. the rest of the ship is basically a huge basement. the music by jerry goldsmith underlines the eeriness so well  and the movie wouldn't have worked without his score. combined with the sounds of the ship it all adds to the uneasiness. this is not a story about heroic people who boldly teams up against evil. it's a story about ordinary people facing true fear  which is the fear without a face. the fear we can't understand and can't negotiate with  because its only goal is to survive on the expense of us. it's a story where some people bravely fight back whilst others are destroyed by the terror. it's a story where people a killed in a completely random way. there is no higher-order justice behind who gets to live and who dies. all seven characters are just part of a race where the fittest - not necessarily the most righteous - will prevail  and all seven characters start the race on an equal footing. none of them are true heroes  and none of them are true villains. all the above makes alien so great as a horror movie. the terror isn't just the alien itself  it's the entire atmosphere which gets so effectively under your skin  that you just can't shrug it off after the end credits like you can with so many other hollywood horror movies. the title ""alien"" doesn't just refer to the monster  it is the theme of the movie and it is the feeling you have during and after the movie. 9/10"
"what makes alien great is it's synchronization of sound  visuals and showing great attention to detail. not only that but alien has an unnerving atmosphere right from the beginning. we're introduced to a crew who is not exactly too friendly to each other add to that the ship. it's huge  and with its halls and corridors  it feels almost like a maze.enter alien  a ruthless parasite with humanoid form yet it lacks any civilised traits of a human. it does have humanoid form but it doesn't give a single emotion. the design of the monster is what's the most terrifying (and it still holds up despite alien being released in 1979). the creature is also better adapted to the ship's interior making a big part of the movie feel like a sinister game of cat and mouse.what i particularly like is how the characters are written. they are not hollywoodized heroes  in fact  there is no hero. they're just people which makes them even more threatened. the performances are all equally realistic and do deliver. kudos to director ridley scott for using crafty cinematography and combining it with shadows and lights in an eerie way. the music is unrelenting and combined with scott's cinematography  sound and visuals it adds to the eeriness.the plot is also not another hollywoodized cliché. it's more like ""survival of the fittest"". the characters battle true terror as they race to survive or outlive each other  they're all just a part of a race to see who will prevail and who will die.final rating: 10/10"
"""high and low"" is one of those films that knocks you off your feet without you ever seeing it coming. that's the best kind of film. the one that surprises you. i wasn't aware that kurosawa could top his already masterful filmography. i was wrong because ""high and low"" just might be my favorite of his.
beautiful cinematography  heartfelt acting and white knuckle pacing makes for a masterpiece of a film."
"""high and low"" is one of those deceptive detective-thrillers that sneak in under your radar and grab you from behind with their storytelling magic. it's proof positive of kurosawa's mastery of film and all its imagery.the story was adapted from an ed mcbain ""87th precinct"" novel  ""king's ransom""  and is really very simple. a successful businessman (mr. gondo) in the middle of a major deal is told his son has been kidnapped. all concerns about money fly out the window...until gondo learns it was actually his chauffeur's son who was taken by mistake. doesn't matter; the kidnapper still wants him to pay the ransom  even though it will bankrupt him. will gondo destroy his standing in the business world to save the life of a child that is not even his? or will he just leave it to the police and fate to determine whether the child lives or dies? this makes up the first half of the film.the second half deals with the search for the kidnapper and his accomplices  and it does not shy away from showing how dull and grueling good police work is. step by step  the cops narrow their field of suspects and build their evidence to link their prey to murder as well as the kidnapping  meaning he would face execution. this makes up the second half of the film.it helps to know that in the original story  the businessman refuses to pay the ransom but does help the police track down the kidnappers. it also helps to understand that in japan  working your way up from making shoes and satchels by hand to being in a position where you could wind up owning the company is a huge accomplishment in a caste driven society. it means he is due additional respect  and this is what gondo faces losing if he pays the ransom  which is far more important than the fact that he will be driven into bankruptcy. from the first scene through an amazingly exciting section on a bullet train to the ending moments between gondo and the kidnapper  kurosawa shows exactly why he is a master of cinema. to take what is basically an episode of ""law and order"" and make it into a meditation on the meaning of life and evil is not something just any film school twit could do.to me  the best moment on a human level comes when gondo descends the stairs the morning after the kidnapping to explain to the police why he cannot pay the ransom for a child not even his. you can see the man realizing he is allowing himself go to hell in order to protect his family and station in life  and toshiro mifune underplays it beautifully...and kurosawa lets it just simply happen. wonderful.this is the movie mel gibson's ""ransom"" wishes it had been. something real and human and meaningful instead of merely kick-ass.ten out of ten stars."
what can be said about this movie? it's a classic. one of the great films. a silly comedy about a very serious subject. if you haven't seen this one yet  it's about time you did.
i never really bought into the kubrick hype. i mean: don't get me wrong; i like all of his films very much - but to me  they all feel somewhat over-constructed and lack a natural flow. and then i finally got to see 'dr.strangelove'. wow. what a terrific  pitch black satire. this film is so wild and mean and funny - and peter sellers gives the performance of his career. unlike in any of kubrick's later works  there's a sense of playfulness here that gives the whole movie a crazy kind of energy; i'm guessing that seller's love for improvisation forced kubrick to ditch his usual perfectionism to a certain degree (and the film is all the better for it). sharp  outrageously entertaining comedy/satire by one of the most revered directors of the past century. 10 out of 10.favorite films: http://www.imdb.com/list/mkjokvqlsbs/lesser-known masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/favorite low-budget and b-movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/favorite tv-shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/
i have no idea why i'm writing this review. there are already 125 other reviews here  and that odds that anybody's even going *see* mine are slimmer than an already-slim person on a severe diet.what's more  i don't have anything new to add. i just finished watching the movie for the first time  and i thought it was just magnificent. wonderful cast  wonderful performances  and a completely engrossing and surprising plot. and even some charming humor on the side to keep things from getting too grim. i was able to foresee some of the ending but definitely not all of it.so anyway  the main point i would want to make is just this: if you have not seen this movie  do not read any reviews with spoilers! just see the movie!
"at the end of the day the films you give top marks are those films that become constant companions. you can see them again at the drop of a hat  you show them to people who have never see them and it's always a triumph. ""witness for the prosecution"" is one of those wonders. suspend your disbelief for a couple of hours and enjoy this banquet of a romp. charles laughton showed here what he was made of better  more clearly and more loudly than in any other film and all of his films  at least the moments with him in it  are unforgettable - captain blight or henry viii  quasimodo or that malefic senator from south carolina. here the severity of his lawyer by vocation takes your senses away with his masterful judicial way to see logic and it's such an incredible fun to watch him do it. tyrone power is a toy in his hands but not marlene dietrich who stands her ground  not merely as a character but as a presence on the screen. billy wilder visits early hitchcock territory with wit and fun. elsa lanchester's nurse is the cherry on top of this delightful film."
"stanley kubrick's 'paths of glory' is the ultimate anti-war film. rather than simply showing us the horrors of warfare and declaring that 'war is hell ' this films genuinely fills us with unbridled hate and anger  revealing the sheer folly and uselessness of combat. there are heroes in war  of course  namely colonel dax (kirk douglas) and his brave fighting soldiers  but certainly not the generals  who sit back in their comfortable armchairs and send thousands of their men to certain death without a trace of guilt or remorse.in the treacherous front-line trenches of world war one  a regiment of soldiers is ordered on a suicidal mission to seize the german-occupied ""anthill."" french general mireau (george macready) is at first hesitant about the attack  citing the unacceptably high fatality rate and his duty to his loyal soldiers  but he is very quickly swayed in his convictions when his superior  general george broulard  (adolphe menjou)  hints at the possibility of a promotion. and so  led by a doubtful but loyal colonel dax (douglas)  the soldiers  in perhaps the most realistic war combat scene this side of 'saving private ryan'  proceed with the attack  suffering immense losses and ultimately being forced to retreat. furious about the perceived ""cowardice"" of his troops  an enraged general mireau orders his artillery to open fire on his own men  but the artillery commander refuses to obey without a confirmation of written orders.rather than taking the blame himself for the failed attack  mireau decides to execute three men to set an example to the soldiers. corporal paris (ralph meeker) is chosen for execution because his commanding officer has a personal vendetta against him; private arnaud (joe turkel)  one of the most courageous soldiers in his regiment  was chosen randomly; private ferol (timothy carey) was chosen because he was something of a social outcast. colonel lax passionately defends the actions of his men during the court-martial  but  despite the utterly ridiculous cases made against them  all three men are inevitably found guilty of ""cowardice in the face of the enemy"" and sentenced to death by firing squad.later  in one of the most suspenseful sequences ever committed to film  accompanied by the slow steady beat of an army drum  the three condemned men are lead to their place of execution  tied to posts and shot down by the weapons of their own army. any other film from this era would have baulked at the final moment  offering its prisoners a last-minute reprieve  and the swift persecution of every general in charge of the original attack. kubrick reportedly toyed with this option at one point  but it is to his credit that he stood firm on his daring and controversial ending. indeed  french authorities considered the film such an offence to their army's honour that it was banned until 1975."
at only 29 years of age and in only his second major studio release  stanley kubrick showed the world that he was a force to be reckoned with. by the time he died 42 years later his films were epochal events waited for breathlessly by his large band of devotees who considered him a director without equal. he seldom disappointed them.this movie is set in world war i amidst the incredibly destructive and futile trench warfare between france and germany. kirk douglas plays frenchman colonel dax  who is ordered to make an impossible assault on a heavily-fortified enemy position. the only reason this charge is being made is that his commanding general  played by george macready  believes that capturing the position will earn him a promotion. when the assault does not go forward under heavy enemy bombardment  the general is infuriated and demands that three men be arbitrarily chosen to stand trial for cowardice  an offense punishable by death. col. dax defends these men at their court-martial.the battle and trial scenes are about as good as have ever been filmed and the high level of tension is sustained throughout the movie. after the film's climax has occurred  col. dax goes looking for his troops and finds them relaxing at a cafe. what he and the viewer witness there is possibly the most affecting scene i've ever seen on screen.looking at this film in perspective  it's easy to see kubrick's trademarks even at this early stage of his career. the attention to the composition of his shots reflects his background as a still photographer and foreshadows his other great films to come. i find myself most impressed today with the way he could handle a dramatic story like this one without any innovative techniques or unusual special effects to hide behind  then turn around and make such totally different films like '2001...' and 'dr. strangelove...' other films like 'the shining' and 'barry lyndon' combined a strong story line with breakthrough film techniques. his versatility astonishes me.adolphe menjou also stars as the general who convinces dax's superior officer to risk the ill-fated charge. ralph meeker  timothy carey and joe turkel give strong performances as the men on trial. turkel turns up 23 years later in another kubrick film  'the shining ' playing the bartender.you can take your pick: 'paths of glory' can rightly be described as one of the greatest war movies of all  or one of the great anti-war films  or as one of kubrick's best. or simply one of the best  period.
"""rear window"" comes very close to be the perfect hitchcock film that illustrates nearly all his great abilities...hitchcock demonstrates in ""rear window"" that he is a great voyeur  that he loves to spy on his characters making each viewer into a voyeur  forcing audience to see everything from his hero's point of view... james stewart is hold up in his manhattan two rooms apartment with a broken leg... he passes his time spying on his neighbors through back window in an orgy of voyeurism...speaking of technical challenge  ""rear window"" is hitchcock prototype... most of the film is shot from one confined set... it is also notably theatrical since it takes place in one room...hitchcock forces limitations on himself  as he did in ""lifeboat"" when he shot entirely on a restricted set  in only one boat... and in ""rope"" (his first technicolor film) where the single setting for the production had only walls and furniture...having restricted his movements  hitchcock is demanded to be ingenious in order to keep curiosity alive... he builds a realistic courtyard of apartments with inhabitants in it  and the restriction becomes a potency and the technique a fascinating example of what he chooses to call ""pure cinema.""hitchcock's camera tracks out through the windows... it never goes inside the apartments... we never see close-ups of the characters... we can only see what stewart sees... we feel like we are watching people through a window instead of in a movie...hitchcock doesn't use any kind of music... we hear natural sounds  occasional live music played in the surrounding apartment...""rear window"" describes hitchcock at his best for the way it works on several levels  yet hides its own complexity... stewart  tied in too by pressure from his high society girl who loves him and wants to marry him... everything he sees out is related to this problem... he avoids to discuss marriage with her  though he himself does not seem to realize it...all the while  the people in the 31 apartments that he can see live out their little lives the tormented middle-aged bachelor  composer/songwriter; the couple who beats the heat by sleeping on a fire escape; the newlyweds and lovers; the tragic ""miss lonelyhearts"" and her fantasies of entertaining gentlemen callers; the hearing-impaired sculptor working day and night; the vivacious and sexy blonde dancer ""miss torso"" who does suggestive routines in bikini tops and  most important  the hysterical ""nagging wife"" - lying in bed - and her grouchy fed-up husband  a jewelry salesman...one 'great shot' reveals just how involved stewart has become in their lives when miss lovelyheart - in her romantic dinner for two - raises her glass in a toast to her imaginary lover and stewart raises his glass as well...the urban backyard setting is the night city terrain of ""rear window "" a night city shattered by the sharp sound of a loud female scream and the sound of breaking glass...hitchcok presents stewart who sees (or think he sees) what he is powerless to stop... the insidious salesman strangely attracts stewart's attention... his passtime becomes an obsession after he suspects that he has murdered his ailing wife and specially when he notices that she is missing... his ravishing fiancée (grace kelly) and his nurse (thelma ritter) warn him that voyeurism is a crime and is dangerous... but stewart persists  eventually he was turned on ... this explain perfectly his specific use of a huge zoom lens to do his peeping as he monitors the murderer's activities... the murderer and his wife became subject of stewart's parody with the ""too perfect  too talented  too sophisticated "" grace kelly...""rear window"" is visually very strong... hitchcock designs the film in such a way so that his view is our view... he manipulates our emotions because he knows perfectly his work... he has the film synchronized in his mind... shooting and editing are  for him  a simple mechanical phase... the creativity has all taken place before...the first shot of ""rear window"" is a perfect example of this reality - as his many typical first shots - for the way it visually transmits the whole complex to the audience...hitchcock is a master at using his camera to create suspense... like stewart  we are restricted in movements  paralyzed inside the apartment  immobile  trapped in a room where we are anxious and uncertain... there is no way we can warn the outcome... this is what 'suspense' is all aboutnot surprise... an effect of intense and prolonged expectancy  lacking all help in the state of knowing that we possess but the characters do not... and  of course  all this great suspense is created by only 'visual' means...stewart gives the performance of his life behaving at ease... he was the perfect hitchcock character: a voyeur by profession  an unpretentious photo journalist who becomes caught in a terrifying event...when you see the film  feel the menacing 'look' of the murderer staring those evil eyes at you... and don't forget to catch alfred hitchcok in his customary cameo appearance  this time repairing a clock... enjoy!"
i must say  no signs of aging. embedded in its day and yet totally relevant. perhaps the most entertaining of all of hitchcock's films. marriage is the theme and murder is the hook. james stewart is as perfect as he's ever been. he uses the contradictions of his character to create someone immediately familiar. thelma ritter's practicality includes a rant about the destructive effect of intelligence. grace kelly enters the scene like a character in a dream. she remains a sort of dream that's why to see her climb the killer's balcony is one of my most cherished film memories. if you haven't seen the film you may think i'm rambling but if you have  you know exactly what i mean  don't you?
"on my first viewing  i wasn't particularly impressed with this movie but i liked it a lot more on the second and by the third - when it's magnificently transferred on dvd - i was fan  too. this is a good visual film  particularly when it shows the inside of this incredible mansion where a lot of the scenes take place.to those who have never seen it  you are warned that it is not an easy film to view  it being a portrait of a pathetic has-been silent movie star who still thinks she can come back after a long hiatus and be a star again. gloria swanson  who plays the role  overacts and certainly is not appealing  even bordering on grotesque at times  but she isn't supposed to look good. that's one of the points of the story. anyway  a young william holden  in his first starring role  is okay and also provides the narration.the most interesting figure in the film to me was the ex-husband-now butler  played by eric von stroheim. he's amazing in this film. in supporting roles  i also enjoyed the wholesome nancy olsen and the young jack webb of ""dragnet"" fame.this combination of drama-soap opera-film noir is one of the professional critics all-time favorite films. odd how they love movies and hollywood stars so much  yet relish films that tear them down  as this does."
"hack screenwriter joe gillis (william holden) accidentally falls in with faded screen legend norma desmond (gloria swanson). she lives in a crumbling old mansion with her butler max (erich von stroheim). she refuses to believe that she's no longer remembered and will never make another movie. she gets gillis to stay with her and rewrite ""salome"" which she thinks will be her comeback. gillis has no other choice and things slowly get out of hand.a very cynical view of hollywood--especially for 1950. it shows what hollywood does to people like norma--it makes them stars  tells them that they're great and dump them coldly when they're no longer needed. it also takes swipes at directors  agents  screenwriters  even entire studios! it has a tight quick script  is appropriately filmed in gloomy black and white and is masterfully directed by billy wilder. everybody thought this was a bad idea when it was being made. it was believed to be too cold and vicious for the public. also holden was warned it would ruin his career by playing a younger man kept by an older woman. but it turned out great and is now rightfully considered a classic.the acting is almost all good. i never thought nancy olson was that good. her character is too pure and sweet to be believable. everybody else is right on target though. holden is just great in his role. you see the pity  anger and helplessness on his face when he realizes norma is falling in love with him--and he's trapped. von stroheim was equally good as max who encourages norma's delusions. swanson however is just magnificent! she has a very showy role and could have overplayed it--but she doesn't. she's mad for sure--but you only see it peeking through every once in a while. when she loses it completely at the end it's frightening. if she had played it like that all through the movie it never would have worked. how she lost the oscar that year to judy holliday for ""born yesterday"" is beyond me. this is a must see and a true hollywood classic but very cold and cynical. a 10 all the way.""i am big--it's the pictures that got small"". ""all right mr. demille--i'm ready for my closeup""."
i agree that the final speech is powerful  and stirring. it made my heart hurt (in a good way ;-) but i also have to say that the comedy is first-rate. when the charlie and the pilot are unknowingly upside down and chatting away...when the pilot is serenely reminiscing about his girlfriend back home even as the downed plane plows right into the ground...when hynkel delivers this vitriolic diatribe about 'the juden' and the blandly impassive translator says  'the phooey has just made reference to the jewish people' and 'the phooey's heart is full of love to all mankind ' ...when hynkel strips his hapless henchman of all his beautiful medals  spitting and fussing a mile a minute...i could go on and on! i think no one else on earth could play hynkel as hilariously as chaplin  but it might be fun to imagine modern comedians trying. ;-)
i was surprised and impressed to find out this movie was released in 1940  before the united states entered world war ii. on the surface  satirizing something as solemn and horrible as nazi germany could be misconstrued as rash. but chaplin's brilliance isn't limited to making a joke out of everything. in fact  the seriousness of his message wouldn't have been nearly as valid if not for the excellent use of humor in this movie along with the moments of stark drama blended in. drama alone wouldn't have had the bite and resonance that this film did. laughing at someone (adenoid hynkel) can be the best way to attack them  while laughing with someone (the jewish barber) can be the best way to love them. in the jewish barber's final speech  i forgot for a moment that the war he was talking about happened more than half a century ago. they are words that have meaning now  and in any time of war. for this reason i believe the film did far greater good than harm  as it still has the same profound effect today.
it's an experience  certainly  and i do recommend seeing it in a good cinema.deakins was fantastic  absolutely  some stunning cinematography.but i found the movie incredibly disappointing overall. feels like a missed opportunity  a very interesting experiment that just does not quite work.most of the movie felt like a series of call of duty cut scenes  a video game you had no control over  a really odd feeling  and some of the scenes were like a video game in content with reality stretched to almost breaking point.to me it was an adventure movie rather than a 'war movie'  much more like indiana jones than saving private ryan... to relate it to another movie i felt it reminded me very much of the revenant in story and style  but like that movie it felt rather empty to me.
"last night col ferry and i (col coldwell  both usa) were able to watch the new wwi film  1917  before it has national release. it is a cinematographic feast for the eyes  long expansive shots that follow the protagonists as they execute their mission. it does not hide the horrors that existed in trench warfare  it shows them for their brutality and abundance. (my great uncle died as a consequence of his service fighting in the trenches  mustard gas poisoning). in many ways it reminded me of saving private ryan.for those who have served in combat (i have deployments to iraq and afghanistan)  i cannot tell you if the film will be too difficult to watch  it might well be  especially if incoming artillery is a trigger. for me  as the camera travels a few inches above the dirt advancing slowly up a berm  my response was visceral. i was taken back to the patrols we walked in afghanistan  not knowing what was around the corner; not relaxing heightened vigilance  not knowing if there would be an ied  a child wearing a suicide vest  a sniper taking aim. for the protagonists in this film (as for all who served and are serving) surviving the climb up the berm  there is no sigh of relief  no respite from the fear of uncertainty. they (we) survive to move forward to face more uncertainty.watching allowed me to pay homage to my great uncle  and the approximate 800 000 other brits who were killed or died as a consequence of their service. (germany lost over 2 million soldiers in the war). estimates put the total casualty numbers for both military and civilians at 40 million  half killed or died from wounds/infection.i rate this film as 10/10  for many reasons. directing  acting  set design  cinematography  musical score  the raw emotion it invokes. some critics have said they never felt a connection with the characters  i suspect they never served in combat. while the brotherhood (including female war fighters) is strong  there is also a common characteristic possessed by all war fighters  the ability to focus on a mission and suppress emotion  even as those around the fighter fall. this was the quality i recognized in the actors and why the viewer doesn't ""bond"" with the main protagonists; we  the viewer  were on the mission with them  we grieve as we can and move on.watch if you will  but know there is no pleasure in watching and the film will grab you and the beginning and not let you go. even though we know the outcome of wwi  there is no joy  there is no peace. watch because it will allow you a glimpse at the horror and brutality of war; reflect on their service and sacrifice. note  as we (the viewer) are ""walking"" through the trenches  glancing shots of the young soldiers shows them with flat affect  isolation  almost apathy; this is the face of ""shell shock "" what we know call post-traumatic stress disorder.for original ww1 footage  watch ""they shall never grow old "" an exceptional documentary."
"i had really enjoyed this movie. i can say this is blast of the year.comedy thrill and much more...
just combination of everything.."
"many have reviewed andhadhun and rated it highly and i am no different. i found it pretty damn entertaining myself. following is just a review of the ending and how enriching that experience was for me as an audience. hope you all like it.watched adhadhun again today. i never made a post about its ending the first time because i liked the director's version of the open ending and leaving it up to the audience's interpretation.however  when i watched it again today  i realized that the film does not have any open ending if you carefully observe it.before i go into the meaning of the ending we have to understand the phenomena of rabbit or duck illusion. google ""rabbit or duck"" for the image and the reference for rest of my review.for decades now  the rabbit or duck illusion has been presented as a test for level of creativity. what you notice in the image determines what part in your brain is more active. a lot of people look at duck only  some people see rabbit only and some see both.of course you can see both if you know that it's an illusion and you pay way too much attention to it and if you try to look for it.however  the real trick is (and this is the next level - not part of the original illusion but something that raghavan has done here)  that what if there is no illusion? but being used to the concept of illusion  we are forced to look for both rabbit and the duck.andhadhun - there is no duck. it's only a rabbit.in the last scene of the movie  the waitress from the restaurant comes outside and gives ayushman his cane back. this cane has a rabbit at its handle (raghavan starts his rabbit/duck illusion here)the movie begins with ayushman's voice telling radhika - ""bahut lambi kahaani hai....coffee? - it's a very long story...coffee?"" (this line is repeated towards the end and that's how the audience know  that ayushman is telling the story of his life to radhika)but interestingly  the story telling takes a pause right towards the climax (when ayushman and doctor in the story are driving off)...the scene cuts to london and radhika says - ""aur phir? (and then?)""this is sort of the writer's way of writing an epilogue solely to ""create the illusion of creating an illusion"". in the epilogue story  where ayushman tells the story of tabu's accident and how the rabbit jumped and caused the accident - there are only 2 souls that can know about the rabbit. 1- tabu (who was distracted) and 2- rabbit (because it caused the distraction)...even ayushman won't know because he was blind. so very clearly  raghavan tells you that ayushman is simply bluffing in this final piece.now some may say that the shooter also saw the rabbit and he could have come and told ayushmaan (blah  blah) - but i am basing my explanation on what is shown. not on  what is not shown and is pure conjecture.here is one more thing - tabu dying would have been a bigger piece of info which radhika would already be aware of since the case was such a high profile one  but she seems to get all this info first hand from ayushman  completely oblivious of tabu's whereabouts until that moment.so raghavan very cleverly tells the truth  but by that time- we the audience are so trapped in this brilliant tale of our hearts wanting to continue in the suspense  that we want to believe there is an illusion for sure.raghavan even more clearly tells it very loud and clear that there is no illusion- by having ayushman's cane with a rabbit(or duck) handle  clearly saying- that ayushman is selling the illusion because he has no way of validating the presence of rabbit but he is telling that in his story.it is absolutely a delightful way of gripping your audience by having them look for things that they invent as they go.adhadhundh (the original word not the movie title - notice the spelling difference) - basically means  something that happens extremely fast and recklessly without any validation or thought - exactly what the ending is.fantastic!"
"this is the most powerful drama i had the fortune to experience this past year. it's up there with michael haneke's amour  but this definitely made me *feel* more. when  near the ending of the hunt  we have some hope for the protagonist  a kindergarten teacher who has been unjustly accused of child molestation  i actually thought something like ""i hope the movie ends right now!"" this because thomas vinterberg (director of movies like festen and dear wendy) makes us feel each and every moment of the great injustice that is shown in the screen. yes  we feel for the protagonist lucas (top-notch performance by mads mikkelsen) but also for his family and friends  especially for his teenage son. obviously the  really wished  ""happy ending"" is highly unlikely as this is a realistic portrait of human nature. in the beginning of the film we have a group of danish hunters (lucas included) sharing good times  drinking  talking  just having fun. apparently they're a real ""family"" of friends. the little daughter of lucas' best friend is the one who begins the sexual abuse rumor  by telling the kindergarten director that lucas showed her his penis. the parents of this girl didn't give her the enough attention; finding more important to be arguing than taking her to school  for instance. and lucas was there to help the girl – it's a really ironic film. the way the families of the supposedly victims react; how the behavior of a family affects their infants; the general thought we have about children; and also those subjects of violence and friendship. everything is shown here in a very credible way. the violence really ""hurts"" you; and i think if a film like the hunt doesn't provokes you *rage*  well  none will. highly recommended  and for sure one of my favorites of 2012. *watched it on 26 december  2012"
"the story of a man accused of child molestation and ""the hunt"" that is a result of that accusation. the performances are astounding all around  not just from mikelssen  which i've come to expect at this point. this movie is emotionally draining  frustrating and if you're a man  downright scarier than any supernatural horror movie you can think of.i watched this movie months ago  and it resonates for a long time after initial viewing. a real work of art and the ending is perfect. if you haven't watched it  do so immediately."
"caught ""a separation"" in amsterdam last night  fully unprepared for its greatness. i hadn't been swept off my feet for a while  but this iranian hitchcockian drama sucked us in for 123 minutes and left us very  very impressed.i'm mainly writing this review to assure every non-iranian imdb-reader that you absolutely should see ""a separation"". i will be shocked if this movie doesn't win an academy award. the acting is great  and the script is probably the best i've seen in five years. the genius of asghar farhadi's story is that it piles on the tension and drama without resorting to fireworks  trickery or shock and awe plot effects. it also manages to perfectly balance the plights of several protagonists. very few screenwriters have this capacity.if this movie reminds me of anything  it is ""ladri di biciclette"" (bicycle thieves)  which has a similar seemingly ""simple"" story setup. but then ""a separation"" is much more developed  much more complex  much richer. go see it."
if mainstream cinema leaves you soulless  see this film. if you have a modicum of intelligence  see this film. if you like great acting and directing  see this film. if you like great writing and editing  see this film. if you have an interest in law  see this film.if you are a parent  see this film. a separation is not harrowing or depressing. fear not as i did before. if you don't like subtitles  you will forget they are there. do not read any more detailed reviews. go without preconception. a separation deserves all the plaudits it is getting and deserves a much wider audience. minimalistic and economic  a separation is one of the finest  most chiselled pieces of cinema of this millennium.
this movie tries to emulate a greek tragedy  which is something expected from a movie based on an arabic story (for example  egyptian movies are almost all so dramatic and tragic)  but it's a flop. many will consider it as kind of 'artistic' but it's not really  it's just very poor material. first of all the story is very contrived and the events highly unlikely to happen (probability almost nil). second  the setting is a deformed and inaccurate account of the lebanese civil war (they changed names and historic events but the backbone is evidently based on that war and that country). as i've seen in some other reviews  with such a setting so removed from reality  the movie lost its impact  it became a farce. a tragedy or a drama is touching especially because it has elements of reality  and when that reality is removed  the movie resembles a ridiculous science-function-like flick that tries hard to be deep but fails. the acting was generally ok  mélissa désormeaux (jeanne) did a good job  however the actress who played nawal (the main character) was a disaster; they could have found a better actress  at least someone who could speak proper arabic.
a bona fide masterpiece. as simple as that. it is ironic that one of the best films about the middle east conflict  and specifically the tragic civil war in lebanon  should be made by a canadian film maker. incendies is based on a play but it feels as though it has been adapted from a great literary work. in fact there is no specific mention of any country in the film but no one can be in any doubt that the unnamed country is lebanon.a canadain-lebanese woman dies in canada and in her will she leaves two letters to her twin son & daughter. one is to be delivered to their brother (whom they did not know existed) and the other to their father (whom they had presumed dead). to find these people they have to travel to lebanon to unravel the mysterious past of their deceased mother. as we follow their search  flash backs slowly reveal to us key moments in the life of their mother.there are extremely powerful and unforgettable images and scenes in incendies. suffice to say that even if you have no interest in the history of the middle east  this film will capture your attention from the start and grips you right till the end. it is the third great film (and arguably the best)that i've seen on this topic after waltz with bashir and lebanon. all of these are essential viewing.
i think this movie is very special for turkish cinematography.cagan irmak(if i were you i would be careful with him.he is great man) told us dying for opinions and the importance of the family.while i had watched the movie i perceive that i want to believe my imaginations in my childhood and never want to grow up.congratulations cagan irmak!because of you touched our hearts in a very beautiful way.in addition i should thank çetin tekindor( if he was born in an other country he will certainly be an actor such as anthony hopkins) fikret kuskan(no comment) hümeyra serif sezer ege tanman(sadik's son)..please don't be prejudiced against turkish movies and watch this movie.you won't certainly be regretful.i think everybody should watch this movie.
very rarely can you find a movie that can make a person shed tears of sorrow one minute  then laugh out loud the next. this is a heart wrenching tale that will make people look at themselves and how they can better their own family units. viewers will find that they will relate to one of the many stories within the movie. it's been a long time since a movie has made me feel this type of sadness and sorrow  followed by a warm fuzzy feeling right in my chest. an amazing film  with amazing people. the supporting actors complete what is truly an inspirational film. it has inspired me to be a better father and a better son. watch this movie.
since i felt none of the other reviews here do the movie justice  i became compelled to write my own. it is the most inspired film i have ever encountered.the creators of toy story 3 have an imagination that is unparalleled. i cannot begin to compare any of the other animated movies that i have ever seen to it. it is a fantasy in an unconventional sense: aside from the talking toys  the environment and settings are typical; commonplace. yet  the pixar team manages to cram every last drop of energy into the incredibly clever story and inventive plot devices out of just common household objects. the animation is so brilliant that it captures shading  lighting  and textures that have yet to be seen on film.then  toy story 3 becomes a beautiful elaboration on the first two  with very clever character development. its maturity of relationships is concise but witty: woody  the wise sheriff  leading the other toys with courage and finesse; a spaceman winning the love of a cowgirl; the loyalty of the dog  slinky; the grumpy married potato and his devoted wife; the superficial relationship of ken and barbie; the broken spirit of a lost teddy bear. at the same time  pixar uses a metaphor that is so strong that it drives the audience to love these characters with all of their hearts. it is a similar emotional complex to a happy puppy who is brought into a home and has nothing on its mind but playing with its youthful owners. but these toys never age  and as its owners  once in their playful youths  leave for work and college  these toys still know nothing more than their youth and happiness of living to one day play again. as you leave for work every morning  your dog doesn't know where you go. and every day  he does nothing more than pray that you come back to see him  every day waiting for you to bring out the ball again for a game of fetch.finally comes pixar's ability to integrate so many emotions - fear  love  action  and comedy  among others - with each having so much vigor in its own right  that the movie becomes a roller coaster of animation and adventure  wound together by the constant movement of setting and storyline  always keeping the audience guessing on what might happen next. it is a brilliant tale; a perfect movie for children and adults alike. i cannot wait to see it again.
i attended a special screening for toy story 3. i went in with high expectations. i loved the first two toy stories movies. toy story is a beloved franchise that almost everyone that i know loves the first two films. now how about the 3rd film? well all i could say is that it lived up to my unbelievably high expectations and then some. this is such a good film. it has the laughs  magic and best of all the entertainment. the new characters in the movie feel like they were in the previous two films  they were that engaging and really worked well in the movie. the best part of the movie has to be the ending  i almost cried and was moved to just about to tears. i truly believe that this is one of the best trilogies of all time. it might even rival the lord of the rings trilogy.this movie has a real chance to become the first animated film to win best picture. i surely would not be surprised.10/10 an amazing end to a fantastic series go watch it
"i will just start with some quotes from other reviewers that describes it the best.""this is easily one of the most overrated films of the year and probably the worst film tarantino has ever done."" ""the only good thing in this movie was the performance of mr. waltz"".""so i was really disappointed  and seeing this movie on place #40 of the greatest movies of all time is the only thing about this  that leaves me with my mouth opened"" now for more details go and read ""hated it"" reviews.one thing i hate about a movie is when it treats audience as bunch of dumb people. (spoiler ahead). now i know tarantino's style is based on fantasy and fictitious plots  but come on  adolf hitler and 200 top nazis officers will be in attendance of a movie premier in occupied france and you have only two guards in the whole theater and the surroundings? where also an american-african walks around freely with steel pipes locking doors and setting fire. these 2 guards are then executed in seconds opening the door for our 2 ""heroes"" to slay hitler at point blank with around 100 rounds... very dumb. at least  challenge our intelligence and create a smarter plot to kill one of the most feared tyrants of all time (go watch valkyrie). besides  mike myers impersonation of a british general is more realistic and authentic than the guy doing hitler  just picture that.what ruined it further  is that the only smart and powerful character  which nailed everyone in the movie  with his psychological and mind bending interrogations  ends up to be effortlessly tricked by the most mindless character in the movie.after watching the movie  i was sympathizing with nazis  who were portrayed to have more bravery and humanity than our basterds!!! imagine that.my recommendations  if you have insomnia  2hrs 33 min to waste or you want to give your mind a break  go watch this movie."
this review gives everything away  so see the movie first.it is neither allegory nor satire  the two finest categories in both fiction and cinema  and yet it approaches perfection anyway. it is of a nature i have no name for  but it is a nature that reveals truth and undermines falsehoods. nothing is more cloaked in falsehood than the victor's depiction of past wars. it is especially true of the children of the victors--especially the children of us wwii veterans  like myself.we get our view of the war from movies like audi murphy in to hell and back or saving private ryan. nothing but praise for our heroes and cheers for killing the enemy. but qt exposes this hypocrisy by engineering a film where we are disgusted first by the excesses of the enemy and then by the excesses of our heroes. that is the first instance. the hypocrisy is slammed home in the second instance where we are first disgusted by the sight of american after american being shot dead by by a german sniper hero and secondly brought to revel in the butchery of several hundred enemy at the hands of our heroes. tit for tat.it fits the pattern of praise for our heroes and cheers for killing the enemy  but because it is presented both ways the hypocrisy becomes self- evident. this is why so many people hate the movie--even if they fail to realize it. high art  true art  10 of 10.
"before the i watched this movie  everyone said it's overrated  overrated  oooooooverrated. and after these returns i thought it's overrated.
whatever
this movie has a good story and awesome acting performance. but  most important for me: awesome editing!!!
lovely soundtrack and cool side story into the bargain!
enjoy it!"
"how happy is the blameless vestal's lot! the world forgetting  by the world forgot. eternal sunshine of the spotless mind! each pray'r accepted  and each wish resign'd. -- alexander pope==> i confess to being an idealist and a romantic. this type of film appeals to people like me... the ones who believe in love at first sight  soul mates  destiny  yada yada yada. the charlie kaufman penned 'eternal sunshine of the spotless mind' is as fresh and original as some of his other screenplays (being john malkovich  human nature  adaptation)  but adds a romantic depth that makes this one of the most complete film going experiences i have ever had.there was an exchange during the film between our two leads  joel and clementine  played with poignancy and nuance by jim carrey and kate winslet  that echoed what i was feeling about the film.clementine: this is it joel. it's going to be gone soon.joel: i know.clementine: what do we do?joel: enjoy it.luckily for me  i knew i was going to be able to revisit the film many times in my life. the depth of the film manifests itself in the fact that the soul mates  joel and clem  both know that their time is running out and that they will never be able to meet again.most films might choose to highlight this type of heartbreak with the death of a loved one or a bittersweet farewell at a train station. but not charlie kaufman. he is bored by clichés. rather  he chooses to dazzle us with the complexities of the human mind and all of its glorious possibilities. he is a master storyteller that is unlike any other i am aware of.joel (carrey) is socially inept. he has had girlfriends  but none that really meant anything. it is as if he has never had a significant relationship of any kind. but  one day  he meets clementine. ""don't make any jokes about my name""  she warns him. she is wild and kooky  changing her hair color from red to orange to blue to green depending on her current mood. she seems the polar opposite of joel  but they click. they click in ways even they can't pinpoint. but from the moment they meet  they know there is something special there.however  after a silly argument breaks up their relationship  clementine decides to visit lacuna inc.  a company that specializes in wiping troubling memories away forever. she has decided to erase the memory of joel. when joel hears this from some friends  he angrily decides to do the same to clementine  erasing her completely from his mind.the erasing process involves a mapping of the memories and an all night process of erasure that is ""technically brain damage""  according to the doctor. the bulk of the film takes place during the process  inside joel's mind. the most recent memories are first to go and we watch as they slowly disappear into nothingness. those recent memories are bitter as we witness the arguments and the boredom of their relationship. but as the time rewinds  the memories get better. we travel backwards and watch joel and clem during their best moments  loving life and loving each other. as this happens  joel desperately regrets his decision. he wants the inevitable erasure to stop  but he is completely powerless. soon she will be gone and he won't even remember that he forgot her. the film focuses on his attempts to foil the process and retain some of her in the recesses of his mind.'eternal sunshine' is directed by michel gondry who also helmed 'human nature'. he has a flare that accompanies kaufman's words with perfect symmetry. this film bounces around on its timeline almost hysterically  but the director never lets us get lost. we always feel in control of our senses and our emotions. it is a tribute to carrey and winslet that they were able to do the same.jim carrey has pulled off a rather remarkable transformation that i would have deemed impossible a decade ago. he is becoming a brilliant actor with qualities that resemble jimmy stewart and tom hanks. he is a fabulous everyman who is sympathetic and knowing  interesting and kind. he deserves tremendous praise for this role. kate winslet is consistently brilliant in every film. she is easily one of the very best actresses we have. here she plays against type  and embodies a fascinating woman who craves attention but needs intimacy. hers is a beautiful performance that will go overlooked. it is easy to understand why joel falls in love with clementine.i think fans of charlie kaufman will be thrilled with this brilliant entry in to his collection. i think the film will appeal to those who loved the recent masterpiece 'lost in translation' or tom tykwer's recent beauty  'heaven'. it is a romantic fantasy with real emotions and real characters that will resonate with the viewer who isn't entirely closed to sentiment. when clementine whispers ""meet me in montauk"" into joel's ear... it's hard to hold back a tear.this will easily be one of the best films of 2004. it is the antithesis of the typical romantic hollywood fare. i loved every minute of its refreshing originality. the film has passion and flare and brilliant wit  all framed by an intelligent script that deals in absurdity while managing to maintain an intimate realism. these characters feel real. you root for them. you want them to meet again and give it another chance. it is a film that will only get better over time  as our memory of it waxes and wanes its way into our hearts.tc candler"
i've never ever felt so good after seeing a movie  and i'm not even a romantic. i've seen it four times at the movies  and i'll buy the dvd the second it gets up on the shelves. i wasn't the slightest bit surprised to see that it's a top10 movie here.
"to start off with  i heard a lot of good things about this movie when it was on the big screens but never got around to see it before it disappeared. sitting here  long after in the aftermath  i might never forgive myself for missing that opportunity. eventually i did get around to see it  though a small tv never does a film the same justice a theater does  and being a bit sceptic about the small hype this movie caused made me prejudice about it  but i must say i have never been so wrong before. and i am happy saying it.this movies biggest crime  and yet its biggest asset  is that it is in french. subtitles just does not bring full justice to a movie like this  and it is bound to scare off most of the audience not used to subtitled movies. sad to say so  but i believe it is the truth. i do not know any french at all  but i sure wish i was fluent watching this movie!compared to most other films ""amelie"" (and i will stick to ""amelie"" since ""le fabuleux destin d'amélie poulain"" is a bit long to write) is based on a rather ordinary and plain story everyone can relate to  but it is given to us in a very special kind of way  mixed with wonderful little subplots and an almost chaotic amount of details. we get to see and experience the world and especially paris through the filtering eyes and fantasy of amelie  a paris that might feel small and limited on the screen but in fact is just as big as it is in the eyes of amelie.director jean-pierre jeunet brings to life the world of amelie with colors  masterful camerawork and a few special effects (well  i have certainly felt like melting a couple of times too in my life!). some people i spoke to before seeing ""amelie"" criticized it for being too childish and unrealistic  but i believe it is an essential part of the movie since amelie herself is a very childish and imaginative young girl. she just happens to fall in love one day when she decides to embark on a quest. jean-pierre jeunet manages to bring us along without losing control of the set or the plot. it is exactly this kind of movie that could easily be overdone and lose all of its magic in the hands of the wrong person  but jean-pierre jeunet never slips a single time. for you who think you never heard of him before he is actually the same man who brought us ""alien 4"" back in 1997  (i still refuse to believe he was involved in that horrible film...)  and the wonderful ""delicatessen"" in 1991.audrey tautou could not be overemphasized for her importance in portraying amelie. i am a bit embarrassed admitting it but i was almost falling in love with amelie myself  forgetting she was only fiction on the screen. however she does not carry ""amelie"" solely by herself. the cast makes an excellent whole and it is hard imagining switching anyone without affecting the whole outcome. everyone manages to make the most out of their role and even though we only get to know some of them briefly they come alive just as much as amelie herself does.i could go on forever about ""amelie"". it contains so many details and switches in tempo and camerawork it has to be seen more than once to take in and understand everything. damn it  ""amelie"" made me happy  laughing out loud at times  and very few movies affects me like that.i very rarely give movies a 10  and i was indeed considering a 9 for a while  but for me this is one of those movies i will come back to time after time. long after the cg thrills of hyped fantasy movies and big budget hollywood productions have faded and been forgotten  amelie will still be jumping around in my heart  doing all those silly and charming little things i wish i dared to do too..."
`snatch'  written and directed by guy ritchie is by far one of my favorite films of all time  it is easily in my personal top thirty.  in the film  about (what else?) several schemes that happen to go very wrong yet manage to intertwine and (for better or worse) resolve themselves in the end  ritchie assembles one of the funniest cast of characters in recent memory. let's see if we can keep this straight:turkish (jason statham) and his partner tommy (stephen graham) are amateur boxing promoters who  after their premier fighter is wounded  have to find a replacement to fight  or one of the meanest guys in london  brick top (alan ford)  who just happens to run the boxing matches and stands to make a lot of money off of the fight is going to impart his unique brand of justice on them.  enter mickey (brad pitt) the gypsy who knocked their fighter out  who is an unintelligible drunk with quite a right hook.  meanwhile  there is a diamond `the size of a fist' that has been stolen by franky four fingers (benicio del toro). on his way back from london to america where he is planning on fencing the diamond  trouble ensues  and his fence  cousin avi (dennis farina) is forced to come to london to find both franky and the diamond with the help of characters like bullet tooth tony (vinnie jones) and doug `the head' denovitz (mike reid).  of course  this can't happen easily  as there are a trio of inept thieves on the trail of the diamond as well as my personal favorite character in the film  boris `the blade' yurinov (rade serbedzija)  or as he's better known  `boris the bullet dodger'.  did you get all that?  the performances by all of the above actors  and several more that i didn't even mention are all really good  particularly brad pitt's.  every single actor in `snatch' looks like they are having one hell of a good time working in the film. this story  while complex and with many ramifications from the core plot is absolutely brilliant and a lot of fun.  there are many one-liners that i still personally use four years after first seeing the film  and the intricate weaving of the characters to tell a very simple heist story is just so good.  `snatch' would be a great film due to its story alone  but guy ritchie's direction is so dead on  the film transcends brilliant and becomes fan-insert your choice of expletive here-tastic.  the slick cinematography  lightning-fast pacing and fun camera angles are right on target with the story.  add on a great soundtrack that spans oasis  techno and a traditional-sounding hasidic song and ritchie has presented the viewer with an instant classic.  while this was not the first time i had seen the film `snatch'  it was the first time i'd watched the film knowing that i would have to analyze it slightly in order to funnel my thoughts from the film just being `phenomenal!' to `phenomenal because..'  while i can certainly be classified as an unabashed madonna fan  and have been for the last two decades  i really hope that ritchie decides to drop his wife from his film work and not continue on the `swept away' path  rather  to get back to the work that has earned him well-deserved high praise.  sorry madge.--shelly
a film about boxing  diamonds  gangsters pretending to be jews  a fat getaway driver  a rather vicious dog and man eating pigs. guy richie has followed the success of lock  stock with an equally stunning and ambitious return just as tarantino did with pulp fiction. the characters are so colourful they jump right off the screen  the dialogue so snappy you want to learn it by heart and the acting simply wonderful. vinnie jones reveals he can act and brad pitt shows that he is far more than a pretty face and could well win a best supporting actor oscar for his role as irish mickey. see this movie!!!!
i just saw requiem for a dream and i have to say  i was blown away. not since 1995's the basketball diaries  has a film so accurately portrayed the craving and depravity of a person dealing with(or succumbing to) addiction. it is a beautifully articulated piece of artwork  intricately presented on a silver platter. director darren aronofsky shines in his brilliant direction and style  in this depiction of the downward spiral of the lives of four people  living with their respective addictions.jared leto  gives an excellent  solid performance as harry goldfarb  a man living an inch from his life  always in search of a fix. in an emotional powerhouse of a performance  he proves to audiences that he can shine through in a major role as opposed to previous smaller roles in fight club and american psycho. however  it appears to be a hollywood in-joke of sorts in that it seems he has a penchant for mutilation or at least the roles he seems to take on seem to have for him. in fight club  he had his face rearranged and in american psycho  his head cut off. in requiem however  it is the mutilation of his life  his whole character  that takes centerstage  ending in a satisfying climax of gargantuan proportions in which he gives the audience more than their money's worth in his power-packed performance.however  the real star of the film lies in the talent of ellen burstyn. audiences will wonder at her appearance at the beginning of the film  not really knowing if it is  in fact  her. her performance as a television  sugar and eventually  diet pill-addicted mother of harry shows that she's still got it after all these years. if you want to make a comparison of her thespian skills throughout the years  watch the revived version of the exorcist. she can only get better. she takes on the role of sarah goldfarb with gusto  never backing down for a second. totally throwing herself into the role  you tend to forget how she really looks like  given only fleeting moments in the film which suggest her real appearance. i have to say  she's got guts. how many female actresses her age would dare to have a camera strapped to her person(as aronofsky so creatively did)  an inch away from her face with a wide angle lens? she definately deserves her oscar nomination  if not  the oscar itself  for her tour-de-force performance.the other characters themselves hold their own with the two abovementioned powerhouses. jennifer connelly and marlon wayans both realistically portray their respective roles as marion silver  harry's girlfriend and rebellious suburbanite chick  who degenerates to prostitution for her fix and tyrone c. love  harry's best friend and fellow pusher. here  wayans shows that he can lose his comic edge if needed  to portray a boy trapped in a man's body  just yearning for his mother's approval but seeking it instead  in drugs. connelly as well  who has been taking on smaller roles and projects over the last few years  is finally given enough room to play with her character and gives a winning performance in requiem.the cinematography of matthew libatique gives total light on the chracterizations of the people in habiting aronofsky's sick world  from the sliently flickering sick-green flourescents to the exaggerated wide angle shots and the beautifully sad and haunting coney island picturesque of the pier which suggests a certain beauty amidst all the sadness and depravity. a downer picturesque  as portrayed by the photographs of robert frank and the frank influenced cinematography of darius khondji in seven. in my books  matthew libatique has just joined those ranks.jay rabinowitz' editing stands out as well  with in-your-face smash title cards(emphasising the downward crash of the character's lives through the seasons)  as well as the close-up constructions of the drug taking process. the latter sequences  edited so tightly and seamlessly  make the moment so beautiful but so fleeting  as is the case with drugs. the sequences are almost like a drug  making you crave for more of them  a fix which you get  whenever the characters get their own fix in the film. lots of people might misinterpret this as glamourising the drug culture but these moments are so fleeting that they're over before you even know it  and then it's back to harry  marion  sarah and tyrone's sick and depraved search for the next fix  which very accurately portrays the twisted quest of a true and sincere addiction.the film is also superbly scored by clint mansell and hauntingly performed by the kronos quartet. a series of hauntingly shocking  yet mind-numbingly beautiful pieces which linger in your head long after you've left the cinema.lastly  the direction of aronofsky  brilliant  beautiful  empathic. there are not enough words to describe his direction or this film and i think the best way to say it is that i am speechless. aronofsky has shown me that  jaded by so many films  something can still prompt me to sit up and take notice. to see something that i have never seen before or learn something i don't already know. the ending  is sheer power. a masterpiece of all the elements of what filmmaking is about  mixed together in some sick souffle and thrown into your face  burning hot and scalding. the film leaves a deep impression  in fact  a huge scar. and it is a scar i am proud to wear.
it's difficult to know what to say about requiem for a dream. i first saw it in the cinema when it was released in england and i have never seen an audience react to a film like this one. the climactic sequence  where the protagonists are effectively destroyed by their addictions  seemed to trigger a bout of heavy breathing in the audience. as it was ending i heard a few people crying. my girlfriend and i didn't say a single word to each other on the bus home.i bought the film on dvd the day it came out  but it took me around six months to watch it again. and only then because a friend of mine was curious. if anything  the impact was heavier than the first time i watched it and i've vowed never to watch it ever again.yet i have still awarded a rating of 10 on imdb and would definitely assert that it's one of the three greatest films i have ever seen. why? the acting is just amazing. jennifer connolly gives the best performance of her career (not too tricky considering the movies she's been in) and remains stunningly beautiful (in a haggard sort of a way) and noble even when she's roped into a gang bang to fund her heroin habit. jared leto annoyed me intensely in fight club but he's perfect as hapless junky harry - forever exuding an air of kindly incompetence that endears him to the audience but that will ultimately destroy him. marlon wayans is equally brilliant - wearing a beaming smile for the first half of the film and a compelling look of confusion and betrayal for the rest of it.as for ellen burstyn... never has an actress been so unfairly cheated out of an oscar (and i've seen the atrocity that won marcia gay harden that oscar for). she is just the picture of sadness the whole film through - a heartbreaking example of what loneliness can do to vulnerable people. the scene where she complains to harry about being old is honestly one of the most tragic things i've ever seen and it makes me want to break down just thinking about it.as such  i can only recommend this incredibly important movie with certain reservations. if your favourite film is 'you've got mail' steer well clear. if 'snow dogs' has been your most thrilling cinematic experience of this year then put this film back on the shelf. trust me  it'll save the costs incurred by those expensive therapy sessions.however  if you believe that cinema is an important tool in helping us understand ourselves and that we will only achieve self awareness by plumbing the absolute depths of despair and self-destruction then you must watch requiem for a dream.
"this is a profound movie that examines ordinary people.  for all their flaws people are basically beautiful and that is one of the many threads of the fabric of this film.  i liked that it was revealed at the start of the film that lester would soon meet his demise.  and i also liked at the ending  the identity of the person who took his life didn't really matter  just the sadness of the loss of his life.  'look closer' was the theme of this movie and lester even had this motto in his cubical.  kevin assumed the persona of lester with a range of acting that is quite worthy of awards.  bening inhabited carolyn in much the same way.  which one of us hasn't experienced the disillusionment of our teenage years  only to later re-experienced it again through our children.  and like carolyn  who among us has not been intensely disappointed with ourself at some point?  that one scene was amazing  it looked so real that it transcended acting.  and can a movie actually move beyond entertainment by causing more than absorbing discussion  but real change in it's audience?  perhaps.  but if this is true  then that movie would be american beauty.  and for those who feel this movie doesn't achieve this lofty accolade.  to them i say  ""never underestimate the power of denial.""  a ten  of course."
"of the 250+ films i've seen and rated on imdb  only one other (schindler's list) is as good as american beauty. a film like this not only entertains while you're in the theater but also drops subtle questions in your head about the nature of human behavior and the gulf between fantasy and reality. after watching this movie  viewers will think long and hard about their own lives as well as the lives of people around them. the movie spells out the social disillusionment phenomenon everyone experiences but can't really grasp.american beauty reminds us that  like lester  we really have no idea what we really want. we're not rational creatures as economists assume we are. our instinct might lead us to perform one action  yet our brains might tell us to perform the complete opposite. we may lust after material belongings  yet how do we know we will still treasure those material belongings once we obtain them? lester may lust after angela  yet once he feels her in his hands and finds out the truth about her sexuality  an entirely different feeling comes over him.ricky fits  the drug-dealing boy next door  is able to look beyond conventional notions of attractiveness and find beauty in non-promiscuous  solemn girls as well as in plastic bags floating in the wind. when many criticize the movie  they say  ""where's the beauty in a plastic bag?"" and that's the point. we live in a world of aesthetic subjectivism. what one person finds attractive  another may find repulsive  yet the urge is there for people to assume aesthetic absolutism. ""it's just a plastic bag! how can there be beauty in it?"" well  a human being is just an aggregation of tissues  bones  and blood. how is that attractive? it depends on how you look at it. reality is shaped by perspective.some people criticize the ricky fits character because he records his life experiences on tape and doesn't actually experience them. but time moves inexorably in one direction. time cannot be stopped. in a physical sense the past and the future don't exist. we are only conscious in the present. everything we do  everything we achieve  every bit of happiness we experience -- they are all eventually buried in the past by time. recording subjective beauty is a means by which one can attempt to salvage beauty from the past into the present because time eventually destroys all beauty. if you don't believe me  walk into a pre-school and then walk into a nursing home. remember that all the old men and women in the nursing home were once little kids.another profound element of american beauty is in the tag line: look closer. an individual's behavior is not independent of his environment. humans are conformists by nature  and humans will modify their behavior to assimilate into existing social categories. if any individual dares to stray from the category to which he has been assigned  he is shouted down and ostracized. no one can resist the urge to conform  so why bother? everyone is nice in public  yet on the streets they blare their horns  scream  and swear. some boys i know pretend to hate american beauty because on the surface it seems like a ""chick flick."" they force themselves to watch gory horror movies and show off to others how they can stomach intense violence and excessive sex scenes. in american beauty  angela acts like a total slut  as many girls seem to be nowadays. in the end  however  she is not what she makes herself out to be. colonel fits tries to act like such a man  yet in the end it's all just a giant facade. civilization is but one giant movie  and members of society must start acting their parts if they want to belong to this civilization. otherwise  they're outsiders. try walking into a job interview without a tie. you'll be thrown out. that is the power of convention.what if i asked you this question: what do you want in life? most people would say  ""happiness."" but is happiness worth deluding yourself for? carolyn burnham shields herself from sadness by adopting a positive-thinking philosophy  a philosophy of self-affirming mantras and harsh self-discipline. positive thinking may help you attain your goals  but positive thinking also blinds you from reality. is it wise or moral to change the channel when you hear about mass starvation in africa so you can enjoy moments of fleeting happiness from a cheap romance movie? self-help is just a euphemism for self-deception. all humans need some complex fraud to distract them from the harsh and nihilistic realities of life  whether it's religion  money  or even love.in spite of american beauty's greatness  there are problems. characters are stereotypical  but viewers will hardly notice unless they're ultra-critical. anyway  exaggeration is essential in satire so that certain points are made obvious to viewers. furthermore  alan ball's original screenplay is slightly edited. the ending is more optimistic.problems aside  sam mende's debut movie is one of the greatest i've seen. not only is it entertaining but it is also filled with interesting ideas. it's an important film for society because there's so much society needs to learn. one boy i knew refused to watch american beauty because  as he said  ""i'm not gonna watch a movie with a name like that!""look closer.10/10"
matt damon and ben affleck shine in a film full of shining moments. there seemed to be very little wrong with this film  and it is a shame the oscar committee decided to pass on this film as the best of 1997. not only were will and chuckie endearing characters  every one else in the film conveyed a smooth and natural performance. even minnie driver proved she could fit in her role as skylar. this film also introduced me to stellan skaarsgard  who i think is a very underated actor. a great follow-up of `to die for' from director gus van zant.
sure  this film's plot is fairly predictable. sure  if you boiled it down to its essential components it wouldn't amount to much. sure  will hunting's genius is profoundly unrealistic.yet i'm giving this one 10 out of 10.i don't know whether matt and ben have ever been in therapy  but they certainly understand a lot about the human psyche  how it ducks responsibility  and pushes blame onto others  how it dismisses the real gifts it has and concentrates on running itself down. how many of us suffer from the same problems as will? only those who deny their own vulnerability will remain unaffected by this film.not only is the script powerful  but the dynamics between the characters - all of them selfish  even skylar - is vividly and plausibly executed. the film just about manages to avoid easy answers  preferring to acknowledge (indeed  highlight) the complexity and pain of personal growth and self-realisation.you could read a lot of self-help books  but they won't bring across to you as powerfully as this film what it's like to be scared  what it's like to experience loss  how difficult it is to shake off your old ways of thinking  how important honesty to yourself is. if this is the kind of revelation matt and ben are going to come up with  i look forward to their future efforts.the first time i saw it  i felt moved as the credits rolled. on my way home from the cinema  i felt sombre. when i got home  i finally burst into tears. this film burns slowly  inside you.as cinema  it's fair to middling. the performances are all first class. the script is a jewel. as wisdom  it's second to none. a fine achievement.
"this translates to must-see! it's a credulous incredible storytelling of a young brother and sister in tehran  and the adventurous saga around one very important pair of sneakers.the two young actors are amazing -- they play their guileless naïve sensitivity with such earnestness! central character  ali  the 9 year old brother  is mir farrokh hashemian  who really carried the film with his legwork  and the younger sister zahra is bahareh seddiqui  who contributed her restrained share of screen presence. the pair is so natural: those furrowed faces  anxious knitted brows -- the range of sad faces the two came up with! the bond between the brother and sister is so warm and joyful - in spite of misfortunes.the storyline is seemingly simple. such story-weaving knack writer-director majid majidi has -- he can make chasing along a streaming gutter into an intense dramatic episode! the story has the texture likened to a thomas hardy novel (poverty setting  episode after episode  turn of events)  yet such a relishingly simple delivery. he doesn't have to tell it all on the screen -- little nuances and observations suffice.it's heartening to see young children who are polite and respectful to their elders  responsible and caring in dealing with their everyday problems  and not give up -- such quiet fortitude in spite of disappointments  such tolerance of their circumstance yet still able to find joy in little things. we catch a smile here and there  e.g.  when they enjoy the impromptu soap bubbles  or when he encouraged his sister by giving her small tokens.this is an absolute gem of a family (value) film. children's emotions untapped  yet adults are not left out -- touches of  grown-up connections: the parents  the elderly couple next door  the shop-owners  all made this world very real.the camerawork  and the well-designed use of sound mixed with accompanying music (different tonal quality instruments were applied) complemented this cinematic experience. a poetic ending -- there's a serenity about it all.i hope ""children of heaven"" will win this year's 71st academy award best foreign film oscar -- it will receive its due exposure and more people will experience this gem.along the lines of poverty and shoes  i thought of  the italian 1978's ""the tree of the wooden clogs"" by writer-director ermanno olmi. and  on a story with substance and good acting by an iranian young boy  there's 1989's ""bashu  the little stranger""  by writer-director bahram beizai. both are movies to be appreciated."
bacheha-ye aseman (children of heaven)it was with some trepidation that i popped this dvd into the player - it was  after all  my first venture into iranian cinema  so i was a little unsure what to expect. i am used to  and for the most part  enjoy foreign films. they open up an incredible world of cinema that one would otherwise miss. after five minutes  it was fairly evident that this film was something a bit special. the story is simple. while at market shopping  ali loses his sisters school shoes. after desperately trying in vain to find them  he decides that he and his sister will share his sneakers  meeting her after to school each day to recover them from her  in order to get to school himself. that is pretty much a synopsis of the entire movie. it doesn't end there however...this film is played with such beauty and innocence; it is a true pleasure to watch. mohammad amir naji plays ali with such incredible depth and passion  one is completely drawn into his plight. from the start of the film  we see the relationship between brother and sister  played with equal warmth by bahare seddiqi  strained as he explains how he lost her shoes. the sorrow on ali's face  and zahra's tears at the news  are truly heartbreaking to watch. the expressions on the faces of the children are so genuine  it is clear that spending a cinematic hour and half will be a pleasure  albeit not an easy one.we see ali and his father looking for work as gardeners. from the outset it is clear that ali's father is strict  but it is also evident he loves his son dearly  and the simple exchange of smiles as they find their first job is heart-warming  and totally believable. cycling through the city  it is very striking that there is a clear division between rich and poor. we are watching a boy  to afraid to tell his father of the loss of a pair of shoes  riding through streets with billboards advertising cell phones  into rural areas where houses with swimming pools  ornate architecture and luxury are rife.there is so much in western civilisation that we take for granted. what to us are simple daily belongings to others is pure decadence. aside from anything else  this film is a window into a world so many of us do not understand. simple things bring ali pleasure  blowing bubbles  swinging on swings with his new found friend  the smiles and laughter of the children is absorbing.later in the film we see ali enter a race in order to win a pair of brand new sneakers for his sister. to win them  he must come third. again we see the division of wealth  as ali races through the streets  the thoughts and images of his sister swirling in his head  and on screen  while at the same time  parents of other children film the race on camcorders  all the time ali running  fighting for the shoes he needs so desperately.the film is directed perfectly  and the credit for this goes to majid majidi  whose films have won acclaim worldwide. there are no special effects  no luxurious settings. there are times when the film feels like a documentary in the direction  and that works in its favour.  this film would make an excellent introduction into the world of foreign cinema. throughout the movie  the expressions and emotions displayed by the children speak far louder than any dialogue ever could.the film is not dialogue intensive  and one could easily watch the film  and understand the story  even without the aid of subtitles. this film was nominated for an academy award  and it not difficult to see why. ignoring for a moment the subtitles and language barriers  since they are not overly crucial to the film  this is a story of true innocence  and tugs hard at the heartstrings  sometimes to breaking point. the portrayal of the children is gentle  warm and absolutely believable  and one cannot help but be drawn into this tale  as it gently unwinds. it is sometimes tough to watch the emotions played out  but ultimately  worth every second.missing this film  particularly if simply put off by the fact it is foreign language  would a sad deprivation of the senses and the heart. it is not just a film  it is an experience  and one that is completely passionate  and totally unforgettable.i truly cannot recommend this highly enough. it is widely available on dvd or vhs - rent it  borrow it or buy it - you will be glad that you did!reviewed by ollie
though i am not a big fan of computer animation i have to give the folks at pixar credit.this brand of animation is nothing short of brilliant.the attention to detail such as eye and body movement is quite remarkable.computers allow them to make their characters as close to human like as possible something we have never seen in traditional hand drawn animation though the latter will always be the closest to my heart.combine this excellence with a genuinely good story idea and a top notch voice cast and the result is good family entertainment.it's obvious that the people at pixar are not only caring perfectionists when it comes to film making but they care about our kids something rarely seen today.highly recommended for any home library.
"i am a big fan of the animated movies coming from the pixar studios. they are always looking for the newest technological possibilities to use in their movies  creating movies that are more than just worth a watch  even when they were made a decade ago.the movie is about toys that come to life when their owner is asleep or not in the same room. when the young boy's birthday is coming up  all the toys are nervous. they don't want to be ignored when the new one arrives. woody the cowboy is their ""leader"" because he's the most popular one of them all. he's the only one that hasn't got to be afraid  but than a new favorite arrives ... buzz lightyear. he hates him and tries everything possible to get rid of him  but as the time passes by they learn to appreciate each other...when you see toy story  you may think that the different human like characters (woody the cowboy for instance) aren't always as perfect as we are used to see in todays animated movies. perhaps that's true  but if you keep in mind that all this was done in 1995  when computers weren't yet as strong and the technology for creating such movies was almost unknown  than you can only have a lot of respect for what the creators did. i loved the story and liked the animations a lot. i give it an 8.5/10."
"i'm talking just in the 90's. the 90's were a great time for the movies  we had so many memorable one's and there is no doubt that ""braveheart"" is one of them. ""braveheart"" is one of my favorite movies that never gets old. despite it's long running time  i will watch this movie any day.mel gibson has come so far in the movie business and he not only stars but directed braveheart. he did a terrific job and deserves a lot of credit for this remarkable film. despite it not being totally accurate with history  anyone can enjoy ""braveheart"". based on the life story of william wallace  a town peasant who just wants to live in peace and harmony with a wife and children. but when the british king of england  longshanks  is sick of scotland ""being full of scots""  he comes up with a way of bringing them more into a british land by ""breeding them out"". promising any british soldier to a scotish bride on her wedding night before her husband can have her. wallace won't hear of it and marries his love in secret. when a british soldier notices his wife and attempts to rape her  wallace comes in and saves her causing a riot in their village and he thinks he's got her safe when he sends her away from the soldiers  but they catch her and kill her right in front of her family.wallace has had it and wants war for not only the murder of his wife and love  he wants freedom for scotland and will shed blood to do it. ""what will you do without freedom?!""  this is one of the most memorable speeches of all cinematic history during their first major battle with the british. through countless battles  friends  traitors  and bloodshed  all wallace just wishes for is freedom. as robert the bruce says to his father ""they look at him and fight by his side."" he describes wallace's bravery and what everyone feels in wanting to be him. i love robert's last line ""you have bled with wallace! now bleed with me!"" and the army stands and continues their struggling battles for freedom! this is such an inspirational movie with a powerful message ""every man dies  but not every man really lives"" to a tearful ending that will make anyone shed a tear to a terrific heartfelt sound track  it's no wonder this won best picture with other oscars. this is a movie  a terrific one that everyone should enjoy and watch.10/10"
the academy award winning war epic braveheart is an extraordinary film that set a new bar for the genre. the story follows a scottish peasant named william wallace who's pushed into leading a rebellion against the tyranny of english rule when his wife is murdered. starring mel gibson  patrick mcgoohan  sophie marceau  and brendan gleeson  the film has a strong cast that delivers outstanding performances. additionally  the battle sequences are remarkably gritty and violent  which adds to the authentic tone of the film. and  composer james horner provides a sweeping and majestic score that's incredibly powerful. a groundbreaking film  braveheart does an exceptional job at depicting both the valor and the horror of war.
"a gang of thieves carry out an armed robbery on a diamond warehouse. the police are after them so quickly that they suspect they have a rat in their company. this film starts right after the robbery  with flashbacks to before the robbery  and to the planning of the crime.after reading this plot  you know this is not your average crime film. in fact  i thought this film was about the whole diamond heist and that there will be a twist ending on who's the rat. it's absolutely nothing like that.although an original way to make this film  this film is mostly boring  with an exception on the prologue of the film which i found entertaining for some reason. this film is very violent and bloody with shooting here and there and yelling about this and that. that's about it with the film.there's nothing interesting with the ""boring"" characters and ""bad"" story. the actings were relatively decent and this film is nowhere near one of the best films ever  although many people said it was  which lead me to buy the film on dvd  which i found a complete waste of money. one good thing about this film is that it's unpredictable and has funny jokes  which in real life would be just the opposite.this film is decent but not a very good film. it has some originality and clever humor but all squished with a boring plot and uninteresting characters. this is just my opinion but i should say for those who want to see this film should rent it first before buying."
"tarantino's brutal debut film. from the original initial dialogue  to the final outcome  the director astonishes everyone and makes clear his style: anthological dialogues (pay attention to the discussion in the distribution of colors that will identify each gangster  hilarious) a breakthrough structure  very good soundtrack (as in all his films)  great doses of violence (although not at all gratuitous  but rather ironic) and  above all  a lot of black humor. in addition to superb performances by harvey keitel  tim roth  michael madsen  steve buscemi and chris penn. in short  a great example of good noir cinema (with all its ingredients: shootings  violence  betrayal  suspense  etc.)  but with the innovative and very personal touch of the brilliant director  who would later continue to dazzle with the wonderful ""pulp fiction"". oh  and the scene from the beginning with ""little green bag"" is legendary. 10/10"
'full metal jacket' was a film that i had been meaning to watch for a while after all the good stuff i had heard about it.it really is a film of two halves  unfortunately i didn't like the 2nd half.the 1st half at boot camp was excellent  we saw a lot of character development and emotion as well as a lot of humour and really serious issues. r. lee ermey and vincent d'onofrio were just brilliant.the 2nd half i didn't enjoy as much  it looked great and there was a lot of action but it was just a bit boring and felt really dragged out  whereas the 1st part just had everything that you wanted.glad i got round to seeing it but wouldn't watch it again  slightly disappointed after a really good start to the film.6/10.
"spoiler: full metal jacket is a 1987 realistic vietnam war film and is one of the best films of the 80's ever made  directed and produced by stanley kubrick. the screenplay by kubrick  michael herr  and gustav hasford was based on hasford's novel the short-timers (1979). full metal jacket (1987) was nominated for 1 oscar. another 7 wins & 9 nominations. it is one of my personal favorite war movies. i love this movie to death. a superb ensemble falls in for for stanley kubrick's brilliant saga about the vietnam war and the dehumanizing process that turns people into trained killers. joker (matthew modine)  animal mother (adam baldwin)  gomer (vincent d'onofrio)  eightball (dorian harewood)  cowboy (arliss howard) and more experience boot-camp hell pit bulled by a leather lung d.i. (lee ermey) viewing would-be devil dogs as grunts maggots or something less. the action is savage  the story unsparing the dialog spiked with catching humor. from basic training rigors to hue city combat nightmare  full metal jacket scores a cinematic direct hit.the film focus on a two-segment look at the effect of the military mindset and war itself on vietnam era marines. the first half follows a group of recruits in boot camp under the command of the punishing gunnery sergeant hartman. in the hell camp the dehumanizing process turns people into trained killers. from boys in to a trained mean machine killers. it's the late 1960s at parris island  south carolina  the u.s. marine corps training camp  where a group of young marine recruits  after having their heads shaved  are being prepped for basic training by the brutal gunnery sergeant hartman (r. lee ermey)  whose orders are to ""weed out all non-hackers"". hartman gives each of the marines nicknames; one pragmatic recruit who talks behind his back becomes ""joker"" (matthew modine); a texas recruit becomes ""cowboy"" (arliss howard). and finally leonard lawrence  a 6-foot 3-inch  280 pound  slow-witted recruit with low intelligence and ambition becomes ""gomer pyle"" (vincent d'onofrio)  and the focus of hartman's brutality  because the overweight boy cannot keep up with the other more physically fit recruits in the grueling obstacle courses. the first half more focus on training basics preparing recruits before they ship them to vietnam and point view story telling from private james t. ""joker"" davis (matthew modine) and about torture physics of a young men who is a marine recruit in the platoon lead by gunnery sergeant hartman his parris island drill instructor who tortures him by punish his whole squad for his mistakes. and how that young man turns in to a killing mean machine that blows hartman's head off! and than pyle sits down on a toilet  places the muzzle of the weapon in his mouth and pulls the trigger  killing himself. the second half shows one of those recruits  joker  covering the war as a correspondent for stars and stripes  focusing on the tet offensive. the film now more focus on one of those recruits private joker (matthew moddine) from the boot camp parris island  who is in da nang vietnam  reporting on the vietnam war for the military newspaper stars and stripes. he and his partner  combat photographer rafterman (kevyn major howard)  meet a prostitute (leanne hong) in the streets and encounter a thief (nguyen hue phong) who steals rafterman's camera. when they return to their base  they are given new assignments  but joker wants to go to the front lines to get a good story. joker and rafterman are assigned to phu bai  a marine forward operating-base near the ancient vietnamese city of hue  joker is reunited with his team recruit from his training boot camp paris island  cowboy and his unit  the lusthog squad  before they met cowboy's unit they are go trough they go to the mass grave and find over 20 bodies in a mass grave that have been covered with lime.the film is staney kubrick's best realistic vietnam war film of all time. one of my all time favorite vietnam war flicks from the 80's  the other film is platoon (1986) once more there's excellent cinematography - check out the haunting  almost claustrophobic landscapes of vietnam. the combination of the demented treatment the recruits receive in boot camp with the combined ""hours of boredom  seconds of terror"" feel of the vietnam scenes is intense and not for everyone  but feels real. i love how the film focus more in a city of hue and the battlefield starts their. the battle scene sequences are outstanding and terrific!they look real  there are dozen's of body's out their. we first see tank driving trough the city of hue the city's are filed with fire  burning buildings and destroyed houses and street is full of blood. sergeant animal mother (adam baldwin) the nihilistic m60 machine gunner of the lusthog squad is one of the most beloved characters in the movie and he is at best a supporting cast member. but you wouldn't even think about animal mother being just another guy. he is so memorable that you look at him as one of the stars of the show. 'born to kill' - written on joke's helmet. is sequent that it has to do with the ""duality of man"" according to jung. 10/10"
"in all fairness  this belorussian-made world war ii picture detailing nazi atrocities  holds a special distinction in world cinema: it is by far the most brutal and emotionally draining of all - in fact  a viewer whose senses have not been properly trained would most likely find it unwatchable. those brave souls willing to be put through an ordeal of almost 2 1/2 hours will find themselves deeply immersed in an absolutely horrifying experience that will not easily subside whether they want it to or not.the title  ""come and see""  taken from the frequently repeating lines of the book of revelation  clearly dares the audience to assume the role of st. john  witnessing the apocalypse  or rather one of the darkest periods in the history of humankind. what we are assaulted with  plays somewhat like a demented version of ""modern times"" transpiring across the panel of brueghel's ""trimuph of death""  if such a combination is possible. the camera is consistently filtered through a murky  slightly unfocused gaze  and the sound is often heard through shellshocked ears. this tends to eirly distance the events  yet make them even more frightening and unsettling. much of the dialogue lacks specific meaning or even concrete sentences - it is replaced by subhuman growling  wailing and other spine-chilling  gluttural sounds of the war. what the director prepares is something spielberg would never even dream of - no sign of compromise with the audience. a crowd of civilian villagers locked up in a barn by nazi soldiers is not spared at the last minute like ""schindler list's"" jews- they are burned alive  and we get to watch all of it.unlike most of the films in this genre  ""come and see"" relies mainly on images and sounds instead of a coherent plot  which is not necesserily a weakness  since the sheer terror distorts time and space into a kind of hallucinatory blur  clearly intentional and understandable. but this incredible level of bleak intensity in the long run  has a negative effect on the film: the viewers have to desensitize themselves just so they can keep watching  so the most harrowing scenes are sat through in numbness.another questionable move on the director's part is his occasional use of surrealism. while some visuals are painfully believable  while others are simply baffling: crazed villages consructing an effigy of hitler  a pensive german commander with a pet slender loris (a rare african primate) on his shoulder  a female nazi eating raw red lobster  not even mentioning a bizzare final montage wich is both inexplicable and obvious  ending with a real-life photograph that is perhaps the most terrifying of all in its implications. yes  at times the movie overachieves its goals and seems almost like the footage in ""the clockwork orange"" that they made alex watch to cure him of ""ultraviolent"" behaviour; yet other times it delivers the kind of jolts those accustomed to mainstream cinema could only wish they had. the face of a youth who had lost all sanity and aged many decades over several days  will be etched for an indefinite amount of time into the memory of anyone who has seen this film."
"even before the final credits rolled  i strongly suspected this movie would end up on my top 20; in fact  perhaps even my top 10. a teenage boy  his hearing impaired from having just been at the site of a bombing  and a young woman clutching at him  the two of them stumbling and sludging through a slimy  smelly bog. a stork in the woods as it rains. a cluster of dolls piled up on the floor with flies buzzing all over the room. you don't need vast  elaborately choreographed battle scenes to bring home the message of the senselessness and pain of war. reading viewers' comments on the movie  it seems that most found the second half  which admittedly contained some of the most powerful massacre scenes ever filmed  as the most ""satisfying"". a few other viewers seem to imply the movie doesn't really get going until the second half. for me  it was the first half that got under my skin the most  for its cinematic originality  poetry and symbolic power. war is experienced by civilians as well as by soldiers: this may seem like an obvious statement  but it's only after watching come and see that you realise how few war movies are truly about the suffering of the ordinary man and woman  defenseless child and frail senior citizen. also  never before had i seen the plight of raped women in war so powerfully conveyed  and all this without the movie ever being voyeuristic or graphic. in cinema  rape is often portrayed as something that looks like rough sex. it isn't always quite clear why women get so upset over it. in come and see  rape is shown as nothing but pure  unadulterated  hate-fuelled violence with only a superficial  external resemblance to sex. unlike other raped women on film  you cannot imagine those in come and see ever healing from their scars. on another subject  whoever thinks this movie contains ""propaganda"" is obviously prejudiced against the movie simply because it's a soviet production  and should think things over a little more carefully. it's astonishing how you can still find little traces of the cold war mentality surviving to this day  even in younger viewers... the fact that as detractors of come and see claim  stalin ""was no better than hitler"" has nothing to do with anything at all  in this movie's context - klimov's picture is not about nationalistic oneupmanship on who had the worst tyrant - it's about the basic suffering of ordinary humanity in war - any war  though this one happened to be going on in bielorussia. there was in fact ten times more propaganda in ten minutes of saving private ryan than the whole of come and see. this is painful  sublime cinema. i've always believed there's something special about russians when it comes to producing art  especially literature - this movie goes some way towards reinforcing that impression in me."
so often when you think of sequels you imagine cynical attempts to cash in on successful movies  efforts to bring in the coins with any old rubbish  when you think of the likes of police academy  halloween and jaws you can understand why  and then there is aliens......not often is a follow up as good as the original (and better in some ways ) but aliens is  i would class it as one of the best movies of all time  a cinematic masterpiece which seems to improve with age. it's a space horror  which is dramatic  action packed and funny at times.aliens changed the genre  sci fi would never quite be the same again. this film will have you gripped  glued and on the edge of your seat  truly an adrenaline fuelled thrill ride  with amazing visuals  wonderful acting  and terrific music. film makers of today watch and see how it should be done.a masterpiece. 10/10
"aliens (1986) is the best epic sci-fi classic action movie of all time and one of my personal favorite best action sci-fi flicks that i love to death. just like i love the terminator and t2  i love this movie to death. james cameron's classic masterpiece. the now classic science fiction film was only the third feature directed by james cameron (following piranha part two  the terminator). it is the sequel to the 1979 film alien and alien is a masterpiece i love that film  but i love this movie more sorry this is my personal opinion this is my movie. i am not saying it is better than the original movie but it is right up there with alien a real classic.  ellen ripley (sigourney weaver)  the sole survivor from the original ""alien""  returns to earth after drifting trough space in hyper sleep for 57 years. although her story about the alien encounter is met with skepticism  she agrees to accompany a team of high-tech marines back to lv-426 and this time it's war! it has great cast i love the marines fighting aliens in this movie. the movie stars: sigourney weaver  michael biehn  carrie henn  paul reiser  lance henriksen  bill paxton  william hope  jenette goldstein  al matthews  mark rolston   ricco ross  colette hiller  daniel kash  cynthia dale scott and tip tipping and they are all believable enough.i love the characters beside ellen ripley  newt  corporal hicks  bishop  private hudson  private vasquez  sergeant apone  private drake  private frost  corporal ferro  private spunkmeyer  corporal dietrich  private crowe i love those platoon of us colonial marines i know i haven't mentioned burke because he was the bad guy and i don't like him. but most of the characters in this movie i love.  i know it is a sci-fi action film but it also does a have a horror mixed together people just don't see that. there's plenty of horror in it. the nightmare sequence in the beginning  the creepy atmosphere of the lv-426 colony  and the heart pounding face hugger on the loose scene in the medical bay. you see mother of those aliens who cocooned all the humans and killed them you see ripley finding the nest and fight the alien queen on the end. ripley faces her fear and gets over her ptsd by going in by herself to rescue the girl/fight the aliens/and destroy the entire nest...battles one on one with an alien queen and whips its' ass...and  by the end  now both her and newt can dream without the worry of any more nightmares (which plagued ripley at the beginning of the film).this is the finest action movie of all time. and  yet  believe it or not  it's not the action in the film itself that makes this be the case. this is especially odd in a movie with a $100 million budget (in 1986!)  with multiple huge explosions  with thousands of bullets fired  and scores from james horner of stuntmen used.10/10 i have the blu-ray disc which it also have a special edition version on it i used to had this film on dvd but i throw it away because i bought the blu-ray which i am very happy about it. i love this film to death it is my personal favorite sci-fi action film even lance henriksen from hard target and the terminator is in here and he is the good guy."
"""amadeus"" is a great film that is deep  thought-provoking  and overall exceptional.  the film deals with the last few months of wolfgang amadeus mozart's (oscar-nominee tom hulce) life  told in flashbacks by an old  washed-up musician named antonio salieri (oscar-winner f. murray abraham). salieri tells of the genius  the ingenuity  and the insanity of the young musician who died mysteriously at the age of 35.  salieri's jealousy may have led him to kill the young composer  but that is something that will never be known.  ""amadeus"" is an interesting commentary that tries to fill holes in history and succeeds amazingly.  by mixing fact and probable fiction  the film-makers succeeded in creating a truly remarkable motion picture that is easily one of the best of the 1980s.  5 stars out of 5."
"i'd like to point out a few facts before i review the movie. first of all  mozart died at home surrounded by his family  pupil and a priest. secondly  the plot of amadeus is not exactly original. rimsky-korsakov wrote a short opera called ""mozart and salieri"" with the bare bones of the story and the identical characterization of the two composers  and he used pushkin's drama for the libretto. so  the rumor that salieri killed mozart has been around for almost a couple of centuries though we all know there isn't an iota of veracity in it.that being said  peter shaffer's movie adaptation of his own play is still an astounding achievement. have you ever seen a movie based on your favorite book and come out of the movie theater rather disappointed though the film version faithfully followed the storyline of the book? amadeus is definitely not one of those movies. shaffer clearly understands the difference between stage and film; the story is more elaborate in the movie  and some of the lengthy lines are replaced with more subtle images and close-ups.i'm often surprised to find that people don't get that amadeus is the story of the fictionalized character  antonio salieri  not the real one  who adored mozart's music but hated everything else about him. in other words  the movie viewers are seeing mozart through salieri's eyes. needless to say  his view is rather slanted. if you have read shaffer's original play  you probably remember he describes mozart's laugh 'grating.' in the film  this annoying laugh becomes more symbolic. though salieri speaks in front of a catholic priest  he is actually having a one-sided discourse with god. at one point  he declares  ""one day  i will laugh at you. before i leave this earth  i will laugh at you."" but as he is wheeled out of his room by an aide at the asylum  what we hear is that screeching laugh of mozart--or is it? it becomes obvious as we watch that this movie is called amadeus because that's what salieri wished to be--god's beloved.the movie might give some viewers who don't know much about mozart a wrong impression that he was a cad  and it gives incorrect information on some of his music (e.g.; the count in the marriage of figaro sings ""contessa perdono"" after he learns that the woman dressed in the maid's clothes is his own wife. there's no mistaken identity here. read the title of the song--countess  forgive me!)  but these are minor offenses. though i am a die-hard mozart fan  i can laugh at tongue-in-cheek references to amadeus in other movies. my favorite? in guarding tess  a secret service agent tells his partner  ""he (mozart)'s a jerk. one day  a guy shows up with a mask  and he drops dead."" what's not to like about amadeus? the tale peter shaffer tells is gripping  the actors are first- rate  and  of course  there's music. the selection of mozart's music in the movie is excellent; you can truly enjoy the beauty of his music no matter how much or how little you know about it. in case you are wondering  a little tune mozart plays on his back and hands crossed as a penalty at a party is viva bacchus from the abduction from the seraglio  a duet for pedrillo and osmin. pedrillo  while singing this song  is trying to get osmin  the harem guard  drunk to help his master rescue his true love. no wonder schikaneder calls it 'our song.' and the improvised version of salieri's welcome march is actually a famous song  non piu andrai farfallone amoroso  from the marriage of figaro.as i said  i'm a huge mozart fan  so my rating may be somewhat biased  but what the heck  i gladly give ten stars to amadeus. i watched it close to a hundred times over the years  and it still gives me a great pleasure every time i see (and hear) it."
"remake from classical movie titled scarface (1934)   in fact   de palma's scarface is dedicated to ben hecht and howard hawks. when fidel castro opens the harbor at mariel  cuba  he sends 125 000 cuban refugees to reunite with their relatives in the united states. among all the refugees  there is one who wants it all  his name is tony montana (al pacino reportedly stated that tony was one of his favorites of all the characters he's played) but the world will remember him by another name   scarface   being a fictional character . in 1980 miami  a determined cuban immigrant takes over a drug cartel while succumbing to greed . as tony and his faithful friend manny (john travolta was considered for the role of manny ribera but was to steven bauer who is the only actual cuban in the main cast and subsequently married melanie griffith) arrive in the u.s. and beginning working small time jobs importing and exporting cocaine. soon  they are hired by omar suarez (during filming f. murray abraham was notified that he had won the part of antonio salieri in amadeus) to do business to a group of colombians. when the issue goes awry   tony and manny leave with the money and flee rapidly . soon after   tony meets with drug ringleader frank lopez (robert loggia   outstanding as a rival gangster) and falls for his boss's girl   elvira (michelle pffeifer   kay lenz  glenn close   kelly mcgillis and kristy mcnichol both reportedly wanted the role   but de palma turned them down). later on   tony reunites with his mother and sister (mary elizabeth mastrantonio).this exciting film packs thrills   chills   noisy action violence and results to be pretty entertaining   in spite of its long runtime   as it runs nearly three hours . it's one of the most violent   gruesome   thrilling intriguing gangster move ever made . al pacino   in the title role   is firs-rate as the cuban gangster and receives magnificent support from steven bauer   robert loggia  mark margolis   harris yulin and early deceased paul shenar gives a bravura performance as a colombian kingpin . interesting screenplay by oliver stone who wrote this film while fighting a cocaine addiction . the original idea was to make this film a remake of scarface  which took place in chicago  but this proved to be impossible due to budget constraints. there was a huge controversy in the city of miami during the making of the film over whether the producers should be allowed to shoot in the city. the miami tourist board decided not to allow filming  as they were afraid the movie would discourage tourism to miami  particularly as it showed miami's latest cuban immigrants as gangsters and drug dealers. a majority of the film was shot in los angeles  california standing in for miami  florida. this was done because production would have been endangered by protest from angry cuban-americans over the film's reported subject matter. streets and buildings used for shooting were redressed by the art directors to have the 'feel' of miami. the movie displays a colorful cinematography by excellent and veteran cameraman john a alonzo . furthermore   it has a commercial musical score composed by synthesizer by usual of the 8os   giorgo moroder. the motion picture was very well directed by brian de palma who liked the script so much that he dropped out of directing flashdance to direct this film. ranked #10 on the american film institute's list of the 10 greatest films in the genre ""gangster"". scarface  the version starring paul muni  was ranked #6 in june 2008"
"""scarface"" has a major cult following even now  22 years after its release.it has also been widely criticized as being very tacky  unrefined  over-the-top and all bloated up! these are people who compare scarface to the godfather movies. it is true that on the technical front  (cinematography  screenplay  direction  etc.) scarface is way behind 'the godfather'.but it is also true  that what scarface has and some other gangster movies lack  is the rawness  the sheer crude approach of the gangsters. the latino gangsters in this movie look much more menacing and real than any of the polished italian or irish gangsters from other gangster classics like 'the godfather' or 'goodfellas'. this is one of the major winning points of scarface and i strongly believe that this fact has been written off as ""tackiness"" by most critics! i have seen the original 1932 scarface  and i must say that both these movies are way too different from each other and should be seen as two different movies instead of praising the original over the ""remake""! al pacino has been criticized to be over-the-top and loud in this movie. but how about considering that that is precisely the way the film-makers wanted tony montana's character to be! he is this angry young man who takes hasty decisions and throws fits of tantrum every other minute! he is not the calm michael corleone here. he is tony montana  a very tacky  uneducated individual who doesn't really think much and gets angry all the time!there is definitely a very 80s feel to this movie. the soundtrack is all 80s! i love some of the songs  including 'gina and elvira's theme'  'push it to the limit' and the title track instrumental.there are some memorable and beautifully shot sequences  including the famous chainsaw scene  the rebenga hit  the first meeting with sosa and tony's visit to his mother's.about the performances: al pacino is brilliant as the angry cuban refugee. he has reportedly mentioned that he enjoyed playing tony montana the most in his entire career. and it really does seem like he has enjoyed himself thoroughly in all his scenes! one wonders what ""scarface"" would be like without pacino. i just couldn't imagine anyone else portraying tony montana and in all probabilities  the film wouldn't be as effective without him!steven bauer shines as tony's friend manny.robert loggia is wonderful as tony's boss  lopez. so is f. murray abraham (as omar) in a small role.then there is some eye-candy in the form of elvira played by michelle pfeiffer. she looks beautiful and is adequate in her role.the director does go a bit overboard during a particular part in the climax. without revealing anything  i would only say that that was the only little part that suffers due to improper handling.""scarface"" is definitely one of the most entertaining and one of the best gangster movies to ever come out. enjoy it for what it is: a raw portrayal of the drug lords and their gangland!"
long ago  in a galaxy far away came a film which saved fox studios from bankruptcy. it was conceived by a 16 year old george lucas after he saw the 1959 film ben hur. this gave him the ideas which are now lynch pins of the entire series - an all powerful force  an evil empire  emperor  a purpose for our universe.this is the best of the series & not just because of the victory over the empire. it springs a surprise in luke having a sister  & completes luke confronting what is left of his father. it destroys an empire & an emperor. it introduces ewoks & then has them join in an alliance to create the victory. it even makes c3po a god  & you can't top that.while it does not have a miracle create the complete victory  like ben hur does with christs crucifixation & events erasing ben hur's mother & sisters leprocey  it does create a man made miracle alliance which ultimately destroys the evil empire. this really counts big in the scheme of things.there is an ultimate satisfaction in the victory  especially when everyone including ben  & darth seem to be a part of it. that is what makes this the ultimate celebration.
totally should've won at least some of the awards it was nominated for! a very different adventure story with lots of adorable characters  more truths and the epic emperor palpatine! i love all the majestic forest aspects. still crazy to me that they filmed so many parts especially the chases. the bulk of this art in cinema is done so well and always entertaining. quite lovable many years later and not many movies have that kind of force!
"one of the few movies that shows the war from a german perspective (the more recent ""downfall"" is also unmissable) and makes for compelling viewing. you identify with the despair  the youngsters' need to ""go home""  the loves left behind  the fear of dying  the dawning enormity of their action as they recede from the survivors in the sea  the sheer fatigue of continuing when every nerve yearns to be free of the boat's confines - the pressures of war  and marvel at the courageous human will that keeps defying all odds and surviving.i found myself on edge for the entire movie  feeling as trapped inside the sub as the crew and even cheering as the boat surfaced in the end against all odds and then  mourning the futility of it all. the movie succeeds in showing the war as a very human tragedy  forcing us to not hide behind anonymous ""enemy"" tags. among many tragic moments  especially poignant is the scene where the captain recants the incident of watching the survivors cry for help. you can almost see his eyes glistening. almost.the cast is superb but the captain is outstanding  his eyes brilliantly essaying his emotions.best version is the director's cut in the original german with english subtitles.what i don't understand is why das boot never won any oscars. can anyone shed light on this? was it a political decision? (btw  i think saving private ryan is highly over-rated as an all-time great war movie)."
"on modern ""boats"" life isn't easy- but compared to the living hell that the german u-boats were  modern submariners have nothing to complain about. people in certain professions don't like to watch movies about those professions (doctors and nurses shy away from hospital dramas  for example). submarine sailors are different. we love to watch every submarine movie ever made  from ""run silent  run deep"" and ""destination: tokyo"" to ""the hunt for red october""  ""crimson tide"" and ""u-571"". why? because we can always use a good laugh. for those in the know  submarine movies are usually absolutely hilarious. except this one. after being in the navy for four years  serving with around 350 different men  and being acquainted with a further 200-300  all of them submarine sailors  i think that i can state with absolute certainty that this film is the only submarine movie that all submariners take seriously. and that is the highest praise a movie like this can possibly get."
"a nicely made dark and majestic experience  see the world through the eyes of a weird taxi driver  as his character progresses from a total embarrassment to a mad dog. the movie sends a clear message about society and human ego  and how a man's pride can drift him into insanity.the mood is nice  a prime example on a classic noir movie  it builds up and prepares you mentally for the big ending.. an ending that failed to live up to the hype that the movie has built in you.. though it had a short yet exciting action scene the ending is pretty simple and is more about delivering a simple message rather than leaving you amazed or satisfied.the dark comedy in the movie is pretty clear  it shows you how messed up society really is  the movie was executed flawlessly when it comes to cinematic and production  but it will disappoint you at the very end  the ending was just too ""meh"" to bear  especially after an excellent build of events preceding it  such a pity.i'm sure the movie was a big hit at the time of its release (after the vietnam war)  but i'm not sure it would be enjoyed the same at our current time  so let me put it this way: - if you enjoy a dark noir mood with nice character development then watch it now. - if you enjoy movies with subliminal messages then add this one to your ""watch when i have nothing else to watch"" list. - if you're looking for a great story with a nice twist to it  i wouldn't recommend taxi driver."
a towering classic of american cinematic power.  martin scorsese teams up with one of the most intense actors of that time to create a masterpiece of urban alienation.  paul schrader's magnificent script paints a portrait of loneliness in the largest city of the world.  travis never once enters into a meaningful relationship with any character anywhere in the film.  he is the most hopelessly alone person i've ever encountered on film.he is alone with his thoughts  and his thoughts are dark ones.  the film fools you on a first viewing.  is travis an endearing eccentric?  sure  he's odd  but he's so polite  and he's got a quirky sense of humor.  his affection for betsy is actually rather endearing.  but on a second view  you see it for what it is.  the audience comes to see travis's psychosis gradually  but there's actually far less development than one might think. when he talks about cleaning up the city  the repeat viewer knows he doesn't mean some sort of giuliani-facelift.  this is less a film about a character in development as it is a kind of snapshot.  to be sure  it takes the stimulus to provoke the response  but does that imply some kind of central change in the character?tremendous supporting roles are brought to life through vivid performances by keitel and foster especially.  shepard's character  betsy  is little more than a foil to highlight travis's utter alienation from society  but she is still impeccably portrayed.  with only two scenes that don't center on travis  it is unavoidably de niro's show.  the life with which the supporting cast imbues their characters is a credit to themselves  and to the director's willingness to let the film develop from the intersection of diverse ideas and approaches.  what would the plot lose by eliminating the albert brooks character (tom)?  nothing at all.  he makes almost no impact on travis's life  which is where the plot lives.  but his inclusion makes the film as a whole much richer and fuller.as a piece of american cinema history  this film will live forever.  but far more important than that  this film will survive as a universal  ever-relevant examination of the workings of the alienated mind.  the story doesn't end when the credits roll.  we know travis will snap again.  but the story doesn't end with travis either.  it continues today in the cities and in the schools.  the film is about the brutal power of the disaffected mind.this film didn't cause the incidents in colombine  or hawaii  or seattle  or wherever you care to look  even with all of its disturbing images of violence.  it didn't cause those things.  it predicted them.
it is the 1930s and johnny hooker and his friend luther coleman are a pair of conmen running short cons in joliet  illinois until one day they target the wrong man. they think they were lucky to get away with several thousand dollars but it is mob money and mob boss doyle lonnegan wants to make an example of anybody who crosses his organisation. soon coleman is dead and it looks like hooker will be next. hooker isn't intending to run though; he wants to get revenge for his friend's death. to this end he teams up with henry gondorff  a specialist in the long con. lonnegan won't be an easy mark though; his only known weakness is his enjoyment of high stakes poker but as he cheats he won't be easy to beat. the poker will just be the hook; to really hurt him they must persuade him to place a very large bet where he thinks he is the one cheating and when it is over he mustn't know that he has been conned it might not be easy but it will be worth it.this film is rightfully considered a classic and for numerous reasons. robert redford and paul newman are on top form as hooker and gondorff and roberts shaw impresses as the villainous lonnegan; the rest of the cast were good too. the film nicely captures the feel of '30s chigago  or at least how it looks in films of that era. of course this would mean little without a good story and this has a great one; the 'good guys' may be criminals but they are likable and the 'bad guy' is clearly far worse; there are also some really good twists. these twists are neither too obvious nor are they too far-fetched. there is some action  some a bit surprising for a pg rated film. also surprising for a pg is the use of some racist language; probably less than would have been expected in the '30s but still a bit surprising in 2017 it doesn't detract from this great film but some patents might be uncomfortable with showing it to children. overall a really good film that all film viewers should check out at least once.
"the fix is in  the odds are set  and the boys are ready to play for the big time  both on the screen and behind the camera in this breezy  endlessly entertaining movie classic.robert redford is small-time hustler johnny hooker  happy to play the marks in joliet until the murder of his mentor pushes him to go up against the nastiest mug in chicago  doyle lonnegan (robert shaw.) hooker'd rather ice lonnegan outright  but will settle for a big con with the help of a slightly wobbly but game scammer named henry gondorff  played as only paul newman can.newman and redford  along with director george roy hill  had a lot riding on this pony  given it was a follow-up to their earlier ""butch cassidy and the sundance kid."" to measure up  they had to produce nothing short of another classic. and so they did. ""the sting"" won the best picture oscar in 1973  and remains the sentimental favorite among many in choosing between the two films.comparing ""the sting"" to ""butch cassidy"" is kind of overdone sport  and tempers  as lonnegan would say  run hot. but you can see why ""the sting"" worked as well as it did by looking at how the director and the stars played it differently within the same basic framework as ""butch cassidy."" newman and redford are again outlaws and underdogs. period detail abounds here as it did with ""butch cassidy "" and there's another memorable score amid the proceedings  scott joplin rags modernized by marvin hamlisch. the score even produced another hit  ""the entertainer "" to compare with ""raindrops keep falling on my head.""what's different about ""the sting "" and what makes it such a classic in its own right  is the way the stars service the plot. in ""butch cassidy "" newman and redford's comradeship was the story. here  the chemistry between the two actors is minimized in favor of spinning a yarn with enough red herrings to feed the swedish navy. the tale here is better than ""butch cassidy "" which is a more elegiac film with grander cinematography and funnier set pieces. ""the sting"" is an edge-of-your-seat caper flick from beginning to end.you can't really call ""the sting"" a comedy. though there are many laughs  especially when newman hooks shaw during a poker game  hill won't let the audience relax enough for that. what this is is a con game  played on the audience  designed not to cheat but entertain by means of clever hoodwinking and constant misdirection plays.you'll get no spoilers from me. this is one worth sitting through with no expectations. five gets you ten you'll enjoy newman and redford  and a terrific supporting cast (one advantage over ""butch cassidy"") that includes charles durning  eileen brennan  dana elcar  harold gould  and mr. hand himself  ray walston. there's another familiar face from ""butch cassidy "" charles dierkop  flat nose curry in ""butch cassidy"" and lonnegan's right hand here. the best performance may be robert shaw's; he exudes menace aplenty but some humanity  too  when he takes hooker under his wing after learning he came from the same hard streets of five points lonnegan sprang from.terrific period detail  too. the dialogue is great and feels real in its runyonesque way  while the cons are elaborate and logically played out. watching this a second time is especially fun because once you know how the plot goes down  you find yourself catching clues you missed the first time  and enjoying the film even more for them.why didn't newman and redford team up again? certainly there was another good movie for them to partner up in  but as gondorff would have put it  only chumps don't quit when they're ahead."
"completely brilliant. this film is amazing in its characterization  its pacing  its character development and its visuals.
the book is superb  but stanley is a genius who has a midas touch.glory glory violence."
it's hard to judge a film such as this. its cold and hard  yet can be exhilarating and sarcastic. it can be average  yet it can be visionary. exploitive? satirical? too many questions to consider when one watches this film.even after 34 years  this film still speaks volumes about our current culture  which many ideals are ringing true today. the younger generations are out of control due to lack of parental control  junk culture is becoming commonplace  violence is desensitizing the masses  and we all seem to be enjoying the ride on the way down. it's very difficult to find movies which can make such startling commentary  yet hold on to such accusations for an extended period of time. nowadays  films are focused-grouped to death  conformity is more powerful than artistry  and money is far more important than quality. kubrick took a huge leap with this film  challenging society to take a hard look at itself. unfortunately  society wasn't ready for this film  which is why it is revered now more than ever.
there are two schools of thought about 2001: a space odyssey.  one  is that it is the greatest science-fiction epic ever made. this is supported by those who claim to understand the complexities involved and leading up the star child ending. the others  like myself  find it as absorbing as watching paint dry on woodwork.the musical background is glorious  the colors are dazzling  and there's an interesting use of hal as a villainous computer. beyond that  there is nothing the least bit interesting about the human characters (trite dialogue and no personality or warmth to any of the individuals)  the pace is unbelievably slow (so the intellectually gifted can philosophize on the mysteries of space)  and the payoff at the end leaves you either breathless with enlightenment or convinced that you have watched three hours of nothingness.i had the same letdown feeling when i watched the clockwork orange  so your like or dislike of this movie is purely dependent on personal taste. intellectuals will take the position that you are a mentally challenged clod if you dare disagree with their elevated opinion of the movie--so be aware that this is not conventional story-telling in any sense whatsoever and only for those who admire stanley kubrick's way with unlikely cinematic material.
"a stand-alone monument in cinema history  stanley kubrick's magnum opus 2001: a space odyssey (1968) is an undeniable masterpiece. 2001 not only shattered science fiction genre conventions  but gave cinema a whole new meaning. from the grandiosity of its futuristic idea to its ambitious execution  2001 isn't concerned with entertaining us- but rather to inspire us with awe. i've never seen a person say  ""2001: a space odyssey? i don't think i've seen it... oh wait  the one with like  the spaceships and stuff?""  while most movies today are forgotten once the credits roll. what viewers must understand is that 2001 not the type of movie where you ""get it"" or not  nor is it designed to thrill us with flashy special effects- but as kubrick said  is ""...intended to be an intensely subjective experience that reaches the viewer at an inner level of consciousness."" in it of itself  exploring the philosophical and scientific arenas of mankind while serving as a groundbreaking achievement both on a conceptual and technical level is a hell of an accomplishment  but to transcend the audience to a whole new dimension all in one- that's sheer genius at its highest form.at its premiere  2001 polarized critics and audiences alike. walkouts numbered well over 200  including rock hudson who asked  ""will someone tell me what the hell this is all about?"" the new york times remarked  ""somewhere between hypnotic and immensely boring."" ""superb photography major asset to confusing  long-unfolding plot "" newsday commented. renowned critic pauline kael even went as far as calling 2001 ""trash masquerading as art"". it's understandable  though. in a time in which excitement revolving around interstellar exploration and extra-terrestrial life was everyday talk  audiences came into 2001 expecting answers. when will we reach the moon? what does the future hold? are we alone? to their great surprise  2001 did the paradoxical; leaving more questions to answer than answered questions.even though the late 60s marked the height of technological optimism  kubrick saw ahead  highlighting the potential negatives of technological advancement. notice the contrast between how apes and humans approach the monolith. the apes approach it with dignity  respect  and mindfulness. the humans approach it with arrogance  grouping astronauts in front of the monolith to take a picture. since the monolith represents the incomprehensible (man  with his limited senses  cannot comprehend the absence (perfect black) of color or light)  kubrick may be suggesting the manner in which we handle new information is careless and hasty  emphasized in the clavius base briefing. scientists discuss how to distribute this exciting news to the public  for ""if the facts were prematurely and suddenly stated without adequate preparation and conditioning""  as stated by dr. heywood floyd (william sylvester)  it may cause ""cultural shock and social disorientation"". it's a significant message to the anxious people of 1968 to perceive fresh information precisely and draw conclusions logically.yet apes are not much better. they're not willing to share food and water with their fellow apes  and with the discovery of bones as weapons  kill their own race for a puddle of water- possibly foreshadowing our own demise if we continue to advance artificial intelligence. because like our ancestors  at heart  mankind has been and will always be selfish.far before the terminator (1984) or the matrix (1999) accentuated the dangers of artificial intelligence  there was 2001. h.a.l 9000  voice played by douglas rain  was ingeniously crafted into one of the most terrifying villains in film history. there's something about his calm voice  unpredictability  and especially  his omniscient single red eye that's so frightening. kubrick utilizes one of his favorite filmmaking devices to compare artificial intelligence with humans: irony. neither dave bowman (keir dullea) or frank poole (gary lockwood) display much emotion throughout the film  while h.a.l  albeit a machine  exhibits some while pleading for life singing ""daisy"" (which  by the way  is a heart-wrenching scene) and murdering his crew members. there are clear connotations of humanity's fate when h.a.l attempts to kill frank  dave  and the hibernating crew members. yet h.a.l  contrast to what he may think  is not perfect. if he was incapable of miscalculating even the slightest bit  he wouldn't have gotten himself killed. kubrick implies that artificial intelligence has not yet reached the level of annihilating the human race  but if we are not careful  they soon will.this idea coincides with the perplexing final sequence  resembling man reaching the next stage of evolution. after the famous ""star gate"" sequence  dave is enlightened in a room. the setting hints at the enlightenment era  exquisitely decorated in 18th century style and embellished with lavish paintings and furniture. notice how the room is solely lit through the transparent ground  establishing a heavenly environment. the eerie silence is ominous  magnifying the mystical aura that is ever so present in the timelessness of the final scene. as dave exits his eva pod  he watches himself age rapidly through one-point perspective. he knocks over a wine glass while eating  suggesting that man  no matter how advanced  will keep making mistakes. as he lays on his deathbed later  he reaches out to the monolith  alluding to adam reaching out to god in michelangelo's the creation of adam. after man is enlightened  he inevitably dies.a pessimistic ending? no. man is then transported back to earth as a ""space baby""  an infinitely more advanced race  marking a new age of evolution. a masterful stroke of genius  kubrick ends hopeful  giving us another chance to improve on our mistakes. or is it hopeful? is he implying that civilization is evolving badly? or is he suggesting that civilization will never evolve? there are multiple interpretations of the ending  and it's a question for you to answer.there is such a great deal of symmetry in 2001's composition throughout the film  possibly suggesting the equilibrium present in the universe. the painstakingly slow pace also compliments the exactness of its harmony  practically forcing you to admire its artistry. while andrei tarkovsky's work would breathe with such organic and poetic beauty  kubrick's artificial visual fluidity mesmerizes the eye with meticulous precision and thoroughness. each shot  averaging 13.6 seconds  possesses a sense of purity and perfection that can only be achieved through the medium of cinema.but of course  it's impossible not to talk about 2001 without mentioning one aspect. the visual effects are so unanimously praised that it's hopeless to even try to describe how groundbreaking and influential they were. hopeless. i can talk for days about the impeccable zero-gravity effects  clever rotating sets  fastidiously constructed spaceships  the brilliant use of slit-scan photography for the psychedelic star gate sequence  or how it pioneered the use of front projection with retroreflective matting  but what's the point? you don't need me to appreciate 2001's immaculate visuals.finally  the choice of music is outstanding. originally  alex north was appointed to score the film  but kubrick turned it down in post-production. critic roger ebert explains it perfectly  ""north's (rejected) score  which is available on a recording  is a good job of film composition  but would have been wrong for 2001 because  like all scores  it attempts to underline the action-to give us emotional cues. the classical music chosen by kubrick exists outside the action. it uplifts. it wants to be sublime; it brings a seriousness and transcendence to the visuals.""""but why all the slow parts?"" asks the one who fell asleep. primarily  to establish tone. unlike the low-budget commercial science fiction movies preceding it  2001 was meant to be taken seriously. it symbolizes a quest for whether god exists or not  challenges humanity's fate  and questions evolution as a whole. if each shot's average length was two seconds and there was some sappy romantic love subplot mixed in between  the whole film would've been a mess. space isn't fast-paced like we see in most movies. space is slow-really  really  slow. the addition of three minutes and seventeen seconds of a black screen in the beginning was also pure genius  a signal for casual moviegoers to get out of the theater now and save your time.thankfully  its ingenuity was gradually recognized  and it's now widely regarded as one of the greatest and influential films of all time. it stands at an impressive #6 on the bfi ""sight and sound"" critics' poll in 2012  ties for 2nd in the director's poll  places 15th on afi's 100 years... 100 movies  and tops the online film critics society list of ""greatest science-fiction films of all time"".2001: a space odyssey breaks almost every rule there is in filmmaking. the first half drags  the dialogue is unnatural  the static camera creates no visual interest  there are barely any emotional punches  characters are monotonous  and none of the protagonists  if there even are  have dimensionality  arcs or epiphanies. nonetheless  it's transcendental and sublime  awe-inspiring and thought-provoking  visually revolutionary  technically impeccable  monumentally imaginative  substantially rich  and way ahead of its time  thriving with unparalleled originality and ambition.only a few films will live forever. 2001 is one of them. happy 50th birthday."
"excellent fun with sadistic humor from leone.  eastwood's best performance in a leone film.  van cleef is good in a role similar to chuck bronson's in ""once upon a time in the west"".  he is menacing and sympathetic  whereas in ""the good  the bad  and the ugly"" he is just campy and all ""bad guy"" (but still fun).  what makes both performances so memorable i think is that van cleef seems to be in touch with leone's dark humor  where eastwood is used as a straight man.  volonte is also excellent in the bandito role leone used (an example of a standard european character type who reminds the audience of earthiness and the basic ignorance and greed of man).  a much better film than most people who've seen it on a saturday afternoon on tv probably realize -- you have to see these movies in the theater to get the full hit."
as the second of the three films legendary filmmaker sergio leone collaborated on with clint eastwood (not to mention his first with lee van cleef and his second with 'fistful' actor gian maria volonte)  for a few dollars more gets well earned respect from the fans of the director and the groundbreaking star. and yet  occasionally there are those who'll not even know this film from leone and clint exists since it does sometimes get under the shadow of their two most infamous works  fistful of dollars (which for the most part introduced clint and leone to the public's awareness) and the good  the bad and the ugly (which solidified clint as a western icon and gave leone a similar status for film buffs). but taken as a film unto itself  aside from its place in the trilogy  this is a western that simply delivers the goods  and it does so with a spectacular marriage of style and substance. the story begins by introducing our two (anti) heroes  bounty hunters douglas mortimer (cleef)  former colonel  and monco (eastwood)  a drifter. they both set their sights on the leader of a gang of bandits named indio (volonte)  who is plotting to go after over a million locked in a bank in el paso. at first  monco and mortimer seem like their after indio for the same reason- reward money- though there seems to be more than each man counted on with him and his gang. from the opening scenes with cleef and eastwood  to the scenes in el paso  and then into the set pieces in the stone ruins in the mexico desert(s)  for a few dollars more displays the utmost skill by leone in his storytelling  as well as in his use of the camera. using fistful's camera-man massimo dallamano  leone does what he does best in his spaghetti westerns- he creates a perfectly in sync mood with his characters: each look in a scene  whether it's intense waiting for guns to be drawn  or just regular conversation  the look of the film draws the viewer in without over-doing it. some points are made bold or repetitious (like ennio morricone's score  that keeps its whistling theme and serene watch theme completely in check)  though it's not done to any degree of annoyance or by accident. in fact  that's what makes his westerns such fun  is that you take them seriously as films  yet he always reminds you that it's all in the 'movie-world' just by the way mortimer or monco strikes up a match. as for the actors themselves  eastwood and cleef are total pros in this genre  so ever line of dialog comes out naturally  and the supporting actors (however dubbed over from original italian) all contribute great notes as well. at the least  it can appeal to a new generation of kids looking back to older movies  which may look at this and consider it more modernly crafted than a john ford oldie. a+
a man has an inner drive that makes him peculiar and intense. he goes to the desert and falls in love with it and its people. gaining powerful sponsors  he has a grand vision that he accomplishes by inspiring and directing thousands. but in a very short time  that grand work is compromised and disassembled by fat cats in offices who are concerned with different values.true of both lawrence and lean. the legacy of lawrence is still in violent disarray (i write this a short time after the sept 11 attacks on new york). but lean's vision was saved  and what a vision! of this picture  it can be said that it is perfect if only because it is so visionary that it defines its own rules.lean's vision is also lean  with vast zones of sonic and visual silence -- several meditations on the unperceived. though there is a story (who are you?) this is really a film of te's 'seven pillars ' which creates a romantic vision of sculpted natural forces. so powerful a depiction that islam experienced a faddish attraction in the west  a place now enjoyed by tibetan buddhism. that was before.see here the original obiwan  every intonation  movement and dress. see here peter o'toole's personality become completely entwined with the character  who is as fictionalized by our eye as by lowell's. see the most expressive  anthropomorphic train wreck in history.watch a particularly interesting brand of acting by the 'arabs.' macho men are acting anyway  so an actor can play an actor when he lands such a role.the star of the film is the clever eye of god  not the clockmaker or judge of the west but the chess player of the mirage. its face is clearest in my mind when the turk holds te down for torture and smiles. its hand in the creaking of feisal's tent -- who would ever imagine the wind acting? (kurosawa's 'ran' at the beginning is the only other example i know.)i have a few films i admire for various. mostly intellectual qualities. but in the direct matter of visual storytelling  this one tops my list.
"did you know that cary grant had been approached to play it? yes  as well as albert finney and that made a lot more sense but it was albert finney who said  have you considered peter o'toole? who? - yes  i love that story. it goes to prove that certain things are meant to happen. i'm sorry if i'm going on about it. but i saw lawrence of arabia for the nth time in a 70mm print in a crowded theater and what came across as the one major reason this film will be relevant forever is peter o'toole. his performance is timeless because it is unique. cinematic and theatrical but always true. david lean brilliantly created a sense of intimacy in o'toole's eyes within the vast  arid landscape. i know the film has its detractors. i heard once director michael apted call it a ""silly movie"" wow  i had michael apted's quote in my mind when i saw the film last and for the life of me  i don't know what he meant. i love this film."
this film dances curiously on the line between depressing/lack of morality and a classically satirical comedy. the staging and dialogue are razor sharp and precise and keep the action moving and the emotions being conveyed crystal clear and tangible  even if the words being said conflict with the truth. the apparent lack of ethics in protagonist c.c. baxter's actions  when he lends his apartment to his bosses and eventually his direct superior  sheldrake  for their romantic rendezvous  make the romantic interest in the elevator operator  miss kubelik  seem wholesome by comparison. while at many points it seems things will careen off of the tracks and spiral badly  the comedic nature of the film always swoops in a saves the plot.
"ohhh - after my 4th or 5th viewing  i think this may be one of the most remarkable blends of comedy and drama to have ever been filmed - the apartment - in subtle ways - rises well above the conventions of any genre. it was my introduction to the great billy wilder  and my fondness for jack lemmon (a remarkable and sorely missed actor) begins here as well.*some spoilers* the cold take on the sex-and-money ethos to be found in many corporate environments hasn't dated one bit; it could be argued that the apartment stands a bit ahead of its' time in the depiction of (what would appear to be) educated employees treated like (and feeling like) tools to be used in generation of someone else's income. lemmon's character never forgets that he's disposable  even if the optimist in him hopes that something better may be found in his superiors. deep down he knows this to be a pipe dream - the sexual adventurism of those same superiors betrays their utter lack of ethics. of course  lemmon's character isn't entirely above it all; he's been more than willing to hire out his own apartment as a place for his colleagues' peccadilloes  in exchange for career advancement  which of course - as wilder early on links amoral sexual conduct and professional/corporate/financial misconduct in a greater social critique - gets him into trouble.the dialogue is - as is always true with wilder - very finely crafted  yet seems natural - this film is a remarkable display of the kind of reactions any of us would offer in similar situations. interestingly  our two protagonists are also wonderfully imperfect as human beings - lemmon and maclaine bear some responsibility for the very serious situations they've gotten themselves into; they manage to realize this (""be a mensch!"" lemmon's doctor neighbor exclaims) just in time to set things right. maclaine in particular delivers a remarkable  complex performance - sweet and smart in her earliest scenes  bleak and emotionally ravaged in her climactic scene with macmurray  naive elsewhere  sharp but hopeful at the end. the cinematography captures the entire cast beautifully - with minimal movement  abundant long takes  and a sleek lack of visual clutter  all of the principals are free to reveal their own best and worst impulses  within an environment that is stripped of artifice. the end result is a film filled with great moments one can easily identify with."
"possibly the greatest ever thriller  nbnw combines terrific acting  dialogue  cinematography  music and storyline. but the real standout is the editing. if there was ever a film that merited the cliché ""a nonstop thrill ride""  it's this one. the pace never slackens. i particularly like how it cuts straight from the mt rushmore face to the train bunkbed. i hate the anticlimactic  overlong  hokey endings of most thrillers. the final scene (scenelet) is very short  romantic dénouement  à la james bond. how refreshing.oh  the champagne dialogue in this movie is simply premier cru  darlings! eve: ""you don't believe in marriage."" - thornhill [indignant]: ""but i've been married twice."" - eve: ""see what i mean?"" or take this repartee... vandamm: ""seems to me you fellows could stand a little less training from the fbi  and a little more from the actors' studio."" - thornhill: ""apparently  the only performance that'll satisfy you is when i play dead."" - vandamm: ""your very next role. you'll be quite convincing  i assure you.""the dialogue is also very risqué for a 1950s film in places. in the dining car  for example  thornhill: ""the moment i meet an attractive woman  i have to start pretending i have no desire to make love to her."" this thinly-veiled propositioning of eve/eva for sex  which sounds banal these days  would have been outrageously shocking to its original 50s audience. likewise  ""i'm a big girl."" - ""yeah  and in all the right places  too."" a cliché now  but imagine its impact then. ""i've heard nothing but innuendoes "" says vandamm at one stage. he's right; there are plenty in this movie's verbal and visual imagery.this dialogue  and the general production design  conspire to create product that  unlike other hitchcock thrillers like rear window and psycho  doesn't appear dated now. the design is ultramodernist  which is reflected in the architecture of the locations like the nyc un hq and the rushmore lodge.a convoluted plot is usually the result of bad scripting or an attempt to mask a movie's deficiencies in other areas. as usual  hitchcock keeps the plot dead simple and doesn't complicate matters by trying to explain. it's just some kind of meaningless cold war spy thing. this perfectly suffices  for it's quite incidental to the thrilling chase that forms the core of the film. what seem like hokey  incredible contrivances  such as eve's coming on so strong to thornhill in the dining car (when we think her unaware that he's not a real murderer) are soon enough fascinatingly demystified. (she's in cahoots with vandamm  or  as we later find  an undercover agent trying to expose him!)fantastic performances from cary grant  james mason  eva-marie saint and a much-underused martin landau. if there's one criticism  it's that cary grant is preternaturally unflappable as the urban sophisticate plunged into a living nightmare. he always retains his self-assured  even arrogant  panache and never panics. in fact  with that ever-present twinkle in his eye  he seems to be getting perverse enjoyment from his own misfortunes. however  his modulated performance remains just the right side of comicality.eva-marie saint is camera-loved as the lethal seductress. she seems the perfect bond girl. had her star risen a few years later  i'm sure she'd have been captivating connery. in fact  this movie shows that hitchcock could have directed james bond. it's no secret bond's film incarnation was modelled to some extent on cary grant's supersuave persona in this film.a young-looking martin landau is effective as the menacing sidekick  although it's only in the final scene in the rushmore lodge that he has any quality screen time or lines. james mason underplays the role of the polished  oleaginous villain perfectly. his very british voice and demeanour conveys menace by suggestion  not overt declaration. he too  like saint  would have been ideal in a bond film. he doesn't sound ridiculous mouthing lines like  ""a bit naughty  using real bullets!"" [my paraphrase][continuity: in the scene in eve's hotel room  thornhill calls for the valet to sponge and press his suit. he's told it'll take 20 minutes and a guy comes to collect the suit a minute later. he pretends to take a shower  whilst eve absconds. thornhill leaves immediately  and he doesn't return to the hotel. however  in the next scene  we see him wearing the same suit  perfectly sponged and pressed. there's no way he could have returned to the hotel to collect the suit.]"
"vertigo did nothing to advance hitchcock's career in 1957 when he released it  and it's actually not a shame: the following year he decided to go completely against the slow-moving erotic thriller genre and do something shamelessly commercial  escapist and single-handedly create the spy movie. ian fleming  author of the james bond novels  states he based his character on the physical characteristics and the suave personality of cary grant  as an added note. this could well amount to be the first james bond film -- a dangerous villain complete with a sidekick  an alluring woman with a dubious nature and an enigmatic ""boss "" a dashing hero  lush locales setting the scene for powerful chases and escalating danger.north by northwest has one crucial difference to any james bond film  though: alfred hitchcock. while the bond films have been seen as quintessential action fluff (although fluff of the better kind until the franchise ran out of gas in the 80s)  hitchcock  always the master of subtext as well as suspense  creates memorable scenes that balance sexual tension  sexual innuendo  comedy  and mounting suspense seamlessly. there is never the feeling of being bored as there is too much going on  especially with the sizzling chemistry of eva marie saint and cary grant  by now a hitchcock veteran. when they're on screen  dialog crackles and so much more is said with so little gesture -- she closes the lid on her ice goddess role  but gives it a nice  cheeky  knowing wink. he of course evolves from the sort of man who while looking and being slightly clumsy and under his mother's thumb -- once it becomes clear he's been marked and is a target for a sinister plot that only later becomes clear -- becomes more assertive in taking matters into his own hands. a quintessential hitchcock everyman  grant has his stamp all over his role. no one can imagine anyone else running away from that crop duster in one of the movies many standout sequences  or saying the reassuring last words to eva marie saint as they cuddle together in the train. when one thinks of north by northwest  one thinks cary grant.easily one of hitchcock's best films  made while he was at the peak of his career in the bracket formed with the man who knew too much and marnie. great supporting performances are all over the map  from jesse royce landis as grant's mother  james mason as phillip vandamm  martin landau as vandamm's protégée who might be a little more than that  and leo g carroll as the professor. doreen lang appears early in the movie as grant's secretary; she would of course be remembered as the woman who shrieks at tippi hedren in the birds and gets slapped by her as the camera holds itself tight on her face."
vertigo is a good movie by a great director. viewing vertigo several times recently  and reading dan aulier's brilliant in-depth look at the making of this movie  i am at a loss to explain what i see as a vastly hyperbolic reaction to this movie by many people both in the realm of professional critics and posters on imdb. this is not hitchcock at his best  although i do believe it could have been. true  hitchcock was at his peak in this period  but there are enough flaws in vertigo to bring this potential masterwork down several notches.the first problem in vertigo lies with the story's failure to establish scottie ferguson. we first meet scottie as he fails to make the rooftop leap and is hanging by a gutter of a building several dozen feet from the ground. after this we see him making his decision to retire from police work. the audience is deprived of any referent to the type of person scottie was before the incident on the rooftop. this failure to establish the character and set a benchmark to measure his return by in the closing minutes of the film deprives the audience of a vital connection to any character. but this problem could have easily been overcome had the third fatal flaw  which i will take up soon  been avoided.the second problem in vertigo is a decision by hitchcock and george tomasini  the editor  to insert a scene shortly after scottie meets judy that reveals all of the secrets the story holds. this throws away the element of suspense that might have had audiences on the edge of their seats during the final part of the movie  unable to relax even at the moment of revelation for scottie's character as the movie would sweep them up and hurl them through the roller-coaster ride that the climax of the movie should have been. but i think hitchcock and company made the decision as a direct result of an even earlier and worse mistake.the third  and most glaring  mistake hitchcock made with vertigo was in the casting. most of the cast does work ranging from passable to outstanding  with one notable exception: jimmy stewart. in aulier's account of the vertigo project he details how stewart came to star in this movie  which had a lot more to do with the desires of lew wasserman  agent to both stewart and hitchcock  than good judgment. jimmy stewart was the wrong man for this role  and aulier recounts that hitchcock himself blamed stewart for vertigo's dismal showing at the box office. hitchcock concluded that stewart was too old for the part and refused to cast him in north by northwest because of this. but i don't think stewart's age was the real hindrance here  i think jimmy stewart tried to step way beyond his range as an actor and falls flat in certain key scenes. mr. stewart does a passable job in the first half of the movie  and is quite believable as the ex-detective brought low by his vertigo-inducing acrophobia. the first real hint of trouble comes in the last scene of the first half  scottie sits in a sanitarium incommunicado and withdrawn as his stalwart friend midge tries to engage him in conversation. stewart's playing of this borders on the comedic with a deer-in-the-headlights gaze that calls to mind one of the warner brother's toons after being conked on the head rather than a man ravaged by guilt. it drags the scene down so much that barbara bel geddes is left to carry it on her own  and she does make a valiant attempt but her efforts are hindered by stewart. from this point forward the movie enters its most crucial phase and stewart's ineffectualness grows more obvious in each successive scene. in the scene where scottie tries to convince judy to change her hair color stewart's phrasing and pitch are semi-comedic. the lack of chemistry between the two leads brings the haunting scene of judy's emergence from the bathroom to a crashing halt as stewart is unable to infuse his performance with even a modicum of passion. but a few minutes later stewart's performance goes completely south as the movie's climatic moments unfold. scottie is righteously angry as the truth dawns on him  but  unfortunately  stewart does not play angry well at all. his maniacal and slightly feminine delivery from this point on detracts from what could have been cinematic magic. at a point in the movie where scottie should have regained his senses and his sense of manhood his tone and pitch shrilly foreshadow the strident tones of mrs. bates in hitchcock's next project.no doubt my remarks here will be met with disdain by some of the film's more ardent boosters on imdb. i shall join the ranks of the great unwashed heathens who do not understand great cinema nor vertigo's rightful placement at the apex of that pyramidal structure. i do appreciate hitchcock's use of color as subtext in the film (i am particularly fond of the color and lighting shifts in midge's apartment when she allows scottie to view her painting). i also appreciate and easily grasp the undertones of hitchcock's own obsessive behavior with the leading ladies of his work  but wonder if that subtext was intended as dramatic irony or whether mr. hitchcock was even aware of the mirror he was peering into. but  the brilliant touches of a master artist are not enough to make up for what this film lacks. hitchcock was indeed the master  and his body of work stands above a field of mostly mediocre efforts that his peers were turning out  and even today not one exists who can approach his mastery  but to suggest that vertigo is the cinematic equivalent of leonardo's mona lisa is ludicrous and undeserved.
"an interesting psychological piece that richly displays hitchcock's talents.  it is unfair to compare this film to the suspense thrillers of today which are subjected to more realism in sex and violence.  hitchcock had to be more subtle in 1958  where i'm sure a work like this  that seems tame by today's standards  appeared bizarre and risqué.  also the acting here seems histrionic; not that people actually spoke like that in the 50s but the audiences liked such dictionally refined dialogue back then as opposed to the lines of modern-day scripts that more accurately portray the way individuals speak.
	james stewart and kim novak are appealing on numerous levels  the former mainly because he doesn't wander far from the amiable joe we have come to expect (even though he does weird-out near the conclusion) and the latter because she maintains a veneer of vulnerability that we can relate to.
	this is not a film i especially like (i couldn't watch it again and again) but i respect for its strong filmmaking."
it has long been thought that the musical era was born out of pure enthusiasm over the ability to put sound on film.  and while the case holds water  it is not entirely correct.  as `singin' in the rain ' so eloquently shows; comedy  charm  music  and dance can all be featured successfully within one film.`singin in the rain ' is also generally known as the greatest musical of all time.  roger ebert  the late gene siskel  leonard maltin  and many other prominent critics agree with that opinion.  the plot was born from a song and used others that had been around for many years  ever since `the talkies' were born in the late 20s.  the screenplay was written according to the songs.  although the cast had been cast   and re-cast several times; the end result was one of perfect chemistry.  the combination of the ever-so talented gene kelly (arguably 1 of the 2 best film dancers ever) and debbie reynolds worked very well  despite complications that arose off the set. and donald o'connor was born for his role as cosmo brown  the best buddy to kelly's don lockwood.  his wit keeps the film fresh and funny.  if you took a drink for every smart remark he made  you'd be drunk  before lockwood gets the girl!all the characters in this film are dynamic  save cosmo brown and lena lamont (played by jean hagen).  this was perfect for what was called for  for this film to succeed.  this helps the film `move ' where other musicals fail.  this is where the irony enters; since this film was written in reverse of this philosophy.  being able to incorporate quality songs into a quality storyline is a skill no studio has ever mastered  even to this day. even  mgm  which was known as `the king of the musicals'  failed more often than it succeeded.  to this day  no one has mastered it; although disney has almost reached mgm proportions with its animation department.as the film opens  the premiere for one of the famed `lockwood/lamont' films is taking place for `the royal rascal.' as the stars arrive  one by one  cosmo brown arrives.  a bit later lockwood and lamont arrive. lockwood tells a `story' of how he and cosmo get to stardom.  to celebrate the release  there is a party at the studio's producer's house.  but to get there  lockwood must go by a different rout than everyone else  finding kathy selden (debbie reynolds) in the process.  after a few cute surprises and accidents  don gets a conscience attack.  after finally finding her  he realizes that he cares for her.  meanwhile  cosmo brown keeps up his antics and funny nature.  the comic relief is never amiss in this film.  lamont soon learns of the romance and is up to something  but what?  what do you think she is  `.dumb or something?'the co-director (also co-directed by gene kelly) stanley donen called the `moses supposes' dance sequence with kelly and  o'connor  the best dance sequence ever.  i agree that it is in the top 3  but not the best  that's in another film; which donen directed  for another review.  all numbers in this film are memorable  where most from other films are not.there is only one detraction in this film.  it is the `broadway melody' sequence.  it begins with another interesting and amusing song and dance number by mr. lockwood  trying to convince his producer of something.  but the scene becomes too long and unnecessary.  cyd charisse is an amazing talent  but the dance number she has in the film  should have been deleted. it is mesmerizing  but is out of place in this film.  this 13 minute sequence should have ended at about 7-8 max.  still  this detail is so minute  that it isn't a bad detraction. when this film was released in 1952  it opened to luke-warm reviews and average box office receipts.  it wasn't until it's `10th anniversary ' that people began to notice that `singin' in the rain' was special and has been known as such ever since.  the afi  when it released it's list of `the 100 greatest films ever ' ranked this film no.10  to put it at the highest mark for a musical of any era and place ms. debbie reynolds as half of the only mother/daughter combination on the list*.  `singin' in the rain ' is always fun to watch  the film has also been recently released on dvd with tons of extras.  as enduring as mr. kelly's lamppost lean is  so this film echoes mr. lockwood's sentiments of nothing; nothing but pure joy that is.personal rating: 99 on a 100 point scale*note-ms. reynolds' daughter  carrie fisher appeared in afi's no. 15 film  `star wars.'
"can you imagine? me  a film lover since the age of six  hadn't seen ""singing in the rain"" until last night. i had read and heard so much about it over the years that i knew i was going to be disappointed. as a musical i've never seen anything so perfectly ""in tune"" i can see how many directors have been influenced by the soul of this gorgeous movie. i've seen even federico fellini here. the tap routine with gene kelly and donald o'connor is so energizing that i wanted to see it again and again. the fantasy number with gene kelly and cyd charisse is breathtaking  breathtaking! how extraordinary to see debiee reynolds going through the contagious (good morning!good morning!) i had seen her a few nights before as grace's mother in ""will and grace"" she hasn't lost her zest. i'm sure i'll be seeing this movie many times and i intend to show it to very young people from the post mtv generation and i'm betting with myself that they're going to love it. greatness is timeless."
"the big concern of movie reviewers  which is to play spoilers  seems inevitable in akira kurosawa's ikiru  which begins with an x-ray of the story's protagonist's stomach and a warning that ""at this point  he still doesn't know he has cancer"".in fact  mr. watanabe  head of the public relations department at tokyo city hall  does not seem to realize what is going on around him. obsessed with the task of applying his stamp to authenticate the documents that pass through his hands  what he actually does is do nothing  ignoring or solemnly giving runaround to taxpayers who come to the section to make complaints.absent from his work for the first time in many years  mr. watanabe receives the news of his illness  and despairs  less for the doctor's evasive announcement  but for the exact description of his symptoms by an inopportune man in the waiting room who gives him less than three months to live (the doctor does not speak  but believes the man would live at least another six months).returning home early after nearly being hit by a truck  the old boss kneels in the dark until he inadvertently overhears the talk of his son and daughter-in-law who unknowingly plan to use the father's inheritance and savings. the scene that closes the first half-hour of the movie is very sad and striking: the old man cries under the blanket for no one to hear while the camera shows on the wall a twenty-five-year award for excellent service.alone  the bureaucrat decides to drink and  in a bar  meets a writer who decides to guide him through places where the man had never dared to live until that moment: pachinko parlors  the red light district  and dance halls. watanabe asks a pianist to play ""life is short  fall in love  dear maiden"" and sings the song himself  causing everyone  including the movie audience  to fall into utter bewilderment. here  takashi shimura is unforgettable.wanted by a coworker  who is resigning and needs his stamp to authenticate his resignation  watanabe starts dating the girl for dinner and outings and has with her the great insight of her life: something meaningful can always be done. returning to his work  the boss decides to fulfill an old claim of residents of a neighborhood: eliminate a pool of stagnant water  building a playground there.the last fifty minutes of the film take place at watanabe's funeral  where successive flashbacks are told of their epic by the city departments to do what they are paid to do. accomplished  the master solemnly sings ""life is short "" sitting on a park swing under a blizzard  and dies softly."
"ikiru (""to live"")is a kurosawa film devoid of samurai or toshiro mifune. it is an oddity in his canon  neither an adaptation  nor an epic  or even a detective story. instead  it is the simple and touching story of the last months of the life of a man  watanabbe  public official  who decides to give a meaning to his life by transcending the obtuse and stiff mind of government bureaucracy to get a small public children's park built. as a parable for the soulless workings of modern bureaucracy  the goal is set pretty high  and kurosawa goes even further  giving this story a lot of character  frequent humor  life and  most of all  heart. and going beyond the strengths of the direction and script  is the central performance by takashi shimura (later kambei in seven samurai). shimura gives his character such a transparently good heart and such great pain that every second of watanabe's plight and struggle tugs at your heart  not in an overwhelmingly sentimental manner  but in one than feels honest and pure. if even many hardened souls will be drawn to tears  it is not for pity  but  admirably  because of envy for watanabe's beautiful human dignity in the end  and for a film to have such power is beyond pure accomplishment  as the need to see this and  more importantly  feel it  goes beyond pure necessity..."
"possible spoilers one of the simplest movies ever made  yet one of the most poignant. of particular note is the title of the film  which serves  in retrospect  to illustrate desicca's main point. in english  the singular title ""the bicylce thief"" causes the viewer to question who really is the bicycle thief in the movie? it is logical to conclude that the title refers to the main character  whom the film closely chronicles. but to call the hopeless  dejected character  with whom the viewer has empathized for the entire movie  a thief would be ludicrous  unless- by calling such a man a ""thief""- desicca is making a more powerful commentary on an inability to define a person or his actions as absolutely good or absolutely evil- the two terms are not mutually exclusive  as there is a blurring between the two that occurs when other factors are considered. the title serves as a reminder that not all criminals are evil- some have been motivated out of good intentions and desperation. in the end  the viewer is forced to make a jarring comparison between the ""thief"" who stole the main char's bicycle and the main char  himself. the irony of the situation causes the viewer to realize his own hypocrisy. though we formerly considered the first thief to be petty and evil for ruining the main char's life  we can no longer hold such a judgment of him after witnessing the main char do the same- an act which the viewer considers sympathetically. the change in judgment toward the first ""thief"" which the viewer is forced to make at the film's conclusion is a reminder to the viewer that one's awareness of the circumstances governing a situation can dramatically change one's assessment of the situation. the italian  plural title ""ladri di biciclette"" serves to generalize the crime  desperation  degradation  to everyman in post-war italy. i also loved this movie for the portrayed father-son relationship. the little boy did an excellent job in portraying a boy who attempts to act like a grown up in order to help  and therefore gain the approval of  his father.however  by the end of the movie we are reminded that the boy is just a boy (which the father seems to forget at intervals  but realizes when he offers to take him for pizza  etc.). the father also has a dilemma- and not just that he bears the burden of providing for his family monetarily  but that he must provide moral teaching and an example as well. moreover  the filial relationship serves to better illustrate the theme of blurred definitions of good and evil. the boy's black-and-white ideas on good and evil is juxtaposed with the reality of post-war italy  in which there can not be such a clear distinction between the two terms-""good"" people are forced to do ""bad"" acts in order to survive. the two different moral characterizations are forced to converge in the young boy  himself  when he witnesses his own father commit a crime. the boy is forced to grow up too soon- i.e.  to abandon his absolute views on good and evil in favor of the grey reality in order to grant his father forgiveness. the ending of the film illustrates that though a child may constantly seek approval and confirmation from his father  the approval which a father must seek from his son  though far more subtle and less obvious  plays an equally important and intrinsic role in filial relationships."
"the italian neo-realist film movement began around the end of wwii with roberto rossellini's open city in 1946.  it is defined and encapsulated by this striking film directed by vittorio de sica.  the bicycle thief is the best of a group of films that depicted the hardship and despair that europeans  specifically italians  went through after the death and destruction of the war.  the economy was horrible  and the towns and cities were half-destroyed and decaying.  rome is the location for the bicycle thief and de sica shoots the city in grainy black and white with non-professional actors to get a simple  yet unbearingly emotional point across.  a simple thing such as a bike can be someone's entire world at that time and losing it means doing something irrational or perhaps necessary.the lead in the film is played by lamberto maggiorani who seems to be a very good actor.  he is not an actor  however  and maybe this is why the film hits its mark so well and comes across so realistically.  maggiorani is of this difficult world and his brooding face is a clear indication of this. his job is to plaster film posters up on the walls of buildings all over rome.  he even hangs a picture that symbolizes the absolute opposite of the misery surrounding him.  rita hayworth from gilda is on the walls all over the city  a sign of joy to some  a representation of their own lowly status to others.when the bicycle is actually stolen  the ""title"" character is sought after by maggiorani and his young son (enzo staiola)  a little kid with so much acting ability  you swear this must be a documentary.  a grueling search throughout rome has the essential parts of the movie  because we see up close the actual people and places the neo-realist film movement came to represent.  it is a small  sad world they live in and the bike has to be found so that they can live.  the father is put to the ultimate test in front of his son.  will he do the honorable thing or will he do what his mind and heart know is only possible? these are the tense moments of the film's climax.there is a lot of the bicycle thief in benigni's life is beautiful and some obvious comparisons have been drawn because of the father-son relationship. they are worthy of comparison and have equal artistic prowess.  what is different about thief is the level of intensity maintained throughout.  i felt the key element was the music by alessandro cicognini  a simple horn that plays so tragically that it is a main character in the picture.  what de sica does here  as well as other neo-realist directors (rossellini  fellini)  is create for american audiences a powerful counterpoint to what we are used to.  an honest  non-corporate portrait of the struggle for life and self-respect.  the bicycle thief is one of the finest films ever made.rating: 10 of 10"
this is a dynamite piece of filmmaking by billy wilder.  wilder is in my opinion a very underrated director  much like john houston.  the acting is in top form from all of the players.  the cinematography is crisp  and beautiful.  the sound is nice and clear  and the direction is arguably some of wilder's best.  however  the real star is the screenplay.  first off  it was taken from excellent source material.  james cain is always great for a story where nobody wins out.  check out the postman always rings twice for an example.  but it is chandler who i think really put this one on the map. chandler has a way with dialogue that makes it all ring in your ears.  the lines are smooth  and the characters always say something that makes me wish i could be that clever and smooth in everyday situations.  chandler knows dialogue  chandler knows la  and chandler knows how to deliver a story. check out any of his novels  and you will see this.  this is a teamup that i really wish would have happened again.  oh well.  if you don't mind voice over narration  then this is a film for you.
"this is one of the best films of all time  not necessarily because of its story but because of the acting  direction  cinematography  lighting  and just the way that the story itself was told. at the time the film was released  the idea of revealing who the killer was in the opening scene was virtually unheard of  but it ended up being very effective because it allowed the audience to concentrate more on other elements of the film  which was the goal of billy wilder  the director. instead of trying to figure out who the perpetrator was  there is more emphasis on how the crime was pulled off  what mistakes were made during the murder  who betrayed who  how close barton keyes (the insurance investigator) was getting to solving the case  and  probably most importantly  what kind of person walter neff is and whether or not sympathy should be felt toward him.
barbara stanwyck  in one of the most remembered performances of her extensive career  represents (with nearly flawless ease) the cold and ruthless manipulator who has no difficulty in ruining other people's lives in various ways (including death  if necessary) in order to get what she wants. known in the film community as the `femme fatale ' this is someone who uses her sexual prowess  seductiveness  and emotional detachment to drag an unsuspecting person (generally an interested man) into a scheme from which she is expected to benefit heavily and he is most likely headed for destruction. in these types of films  the man often either finds his life in ruins or ends up dead  as is often (but not always) also the case with the fate of the femme fatale. barbara stanwyck (as phyllis dietrichson  the murderous femme fatale in double indemnity) and fred macmurray (as walter neff  her victim')  have amazing chemistry on screen. their attraction is incredibly well portrayed  and the development of their relationship with each other is so convincing that what happens between them almost seems normal. besides that  their mutually calculated interaction  although it seems at first like it has been rehearsed endlessly and ultimately brought unconvincingly to the screen  is exactly as it was meant to be  because it represents each character's intentions  even very subtly foreshadowing their future betrayals against each other. phyllis has gone through every word she ever says to walter in her head. she has practiced what she wants to say when she brings up the idea of life insurance to walter in the beginning and she knows what she wants to say whenever they interact with each other because she has been planning for quite some time the prospect of murdering her husband in order to collect his fortune. walter  conversely  methodically makes amorous advances as though this is something that he does regularly  and then ultimately he also plans out his conversations with phyllis because he begins to suspect her and is sure to tell her only what he wants her to hear. this seemingly stiff dialogue brilliantly represents phyllis and walter's precise (and sinister) intentions  and it's quick pace creates a feeling of urgency and restlessness.probably the most fascinating and entertaining actor in the film  edward g. robinson  plays barton keyes  walter's friend and employer at the insurance company where he works. keyes is a very suspicious man who closely investigates the insurance claims which come into the company  having a striking history of accurately isolating fraudulent claims and throwing them out. his handling of phyllis's (and walter's  technically) claim and the way that he gets closer and closer to the truth create a great atmosphere of tension and drama. double indemnity is nearly flawless. from the shocking and unexpected beginning to the already known but still surprising end  the audience is held rapt by the excellent performances  the brilliant and imaginative direction  and the flawlessly created atmosphere. this is excellent  excellent filmmaking  and is a classic film that should not be missed."
"if ever there was a film that i had a love-hate relationship with  ""citizen kane"" is surely it. some of the non-script elements are as good as what one would find in any other film. yet  the story of charles foster kane (orson welles)  an early twentieth century newspaper tycoon is terribly dated and painfully boring.the film's b&w cinematography is arguably the best in film history. dp gregg toland uses high-contrast lighting and murky shadows to create a wonderfully noir look and feel. and in some scenes bright back-lighting puts foreground characters in stark silhouette  creating an authoritarian and oppressive tone to the story. this is true especially in the film's first thirty minutes. throughout the film  frame compositions are clever and interesting  like one scene in the second half wherein a woman  with her back to the camera  blares out an operatic aria on stage to an audience that we viewers cannot see  amid murky  shadowy lighting; it's like something from a nightmare.and the film's visuals are laced with strange optical illusions  as a result of welles' use of deep focus camera techniques. in one scene  for example  background windows appear normal in size relative to characters in the foreground. but when a character walks back to the windows  we see that the windows are actually much larger and higher than first appeared  and that renders the character small  by comparison. the same optical effects show up in the great hall of xanadu  with a fireplace that appears average in size  until a character walks back to it; at which point the fireplace is seen in its true size; it's so big and high as to overwhelm the human figure.sound effects amplify these optical effects. for example  in the great hall  the cavernous  mostly empty  room strongly echoes human sounds  creating the impression of some huge  dark cave. the whole feel is one of oppression and death. just terrific.but the film's story  about a corpulent newspaper tycoon  is so dated as to be largely irrelevant in the twenty first century. kane starts out with noble intent to help the lower classes. but over time he changes. and throughout  he is egotistical  overbearing  bombastic  loud  and generally too full of himself. his only real belief is in himself. he is fond of possessions  but is emotionally empty. in addition to an unlikeable protagonist  the script's dialogue is very talky.the film's acting is generally quite good. i particularly liked the performances of joseph cotten  dorothy comingore  and agnes moorehead. special effects are good too and  when combined with lots of stock footage  create the visual illusion of a cinematic epic.some viewers love this film; others loathe it. i love the cinematography and sound effects  but loathe the story. ""citizen kane"" should have won several oscars  including especially cinematography. that it did not has caused hollywood endless guilt  and to compensate  they routinely vote the film as ""the number one greatest film in history"".but it does not deserve that lofty title. hollywood needs to give the film several postmortem  but well deserved  oscars  especially for b&w cinematography. then  they need to let go of the guilt."
"it's a difficult undertaking for someone of my generation to watch a film like citizen kane.  not because it's ""too old"" or ""too boring""  but because it has been hailed--almost universally--as the single best motion picture ever made.  and while the anticipation of seeing a film with such overwhelming acclaim may be quite exhilarating  actually watching it is ultimately an intimidating and somewhat disappointing experience.this isn't to say that i thought citizen kane was a bad film; in fact  i thought everything about it was downright brilliant.  from the enchanting performances right down to the meticulously planned camera movements and clever lighting tricks  there isn't a single element of citizen kane that isn't a stunning achievement in all areas of filmmaking.citizen kane's storyline is deceptively simple.  even though the plot unfolds by jumping in and out of nonlinear flashbacks  it is surprisingly easy to keep track of.  the straightforwardness and relatively fast pace of the story are what make it seem intimidating.  because everything moves smoothly along without any standstill  it feels like we are being fooled-like there is something much greater that we just can't seem to grasp.  as a first-time viewer  i knew from its reputation that there must be *something* that separates this movie from all the others; something buried within its simple plotline that everybody else has seen  but that i just could not seem to get a handle on.  and then  during those final frames  that something was revealed  and it all began to make sense.  to me  it was these moments of confusion and uncertainty followed by a sense of enlightenment and appreciation that made watching citizen kane such a meaningful experience.but no matter how great of a movie citizen kane really is  it can never live up to one's expectations.  although i do feel that it is deserving of its acclamation  the constant exposure to its six decades worth of hype and praise will invariably set most modern viewers' standards at a height that is virtually unreachable--even if it really *is* the best movie of all time."

"fritz lang's highly influential career as a film director began in post world war i germany  where he was a leading figure in the german expressionist film movement  and ended in the united states in 1953 with the production of the big heat  a film noir classic. perhaps his greatest film  m (germany  1931) forms an historical bridge between expressionism and film noir. like the former it uses strange and disturbing compositions of light and dark in order to symbolize the inner workings of the human mind; like the latter it more realistically sets its story in a modern urban setting and blends in sociological issues along with the psychological and moral ones. even though m was lang's (and germany's) first sound film  many historians cite it as the initial masterpiece of cinema to appear following the introduction of sound into films in the late 1920's. while most early ""talkies"" return films to their static  visually monotonous  stage- imitative beginnings and thus limit rather than expand the artistic possibilities of the medium  m avoids the failing by skillfully balancing asynchronous  off-screen sounds with the more limiting use of synchronous dialogue. the film's editing  particularly its elaborate use of parallel cutting  also contributes kinetic energy and fluidity to the storytelling. of course  many of the film's sound effects are also imaginative and memorable  none more so than the compulsive whistling of the film's central character  the stalker and serial killer of little girls hans beckert (magnificently played by peter lorre). sound is also an important contributor to m's rich and influential use of off screen space. one famous example is the scene that introduces beckert as a shadow against his own wanted poster  creepily intoning to his next victim  elsie beckmann  ""you have a very pretty ball."" not only is beckert's shadow a bow toward lang's expressionist artistic roots  but it ironically places the murderer in the implied space in front of the image - that is  among us  the human community of viewers of which he is an innocuous-appearing  albeit monstrous  member. another example of lang's use of off-screen space is the montage of shots whose common denominator is elsie's absence from them: an empty chair at the beckmann dinner table  the vertiginous stairwell down which elsie's mother searches compulsively and futilely for signs of her daughter's arrival  the attic play area that awaits elsie's return from school. most memorable of all - and most often alluded to visually in other films - is the series of shots that indirectly record beckert's assault and murder of the innocent child  representing these off screen events metonymically via the entry of elsie's ball from bushes along on the right edge of the frame and the release of her balloon from telephone wires and off the left edge of the frame. never in the history of cinema has something so terrible been communicated through such powerfully understated images.beyond its technical brilliance  the keys to m's lasting impact are its psychologically convincing portrait of hans beckert's twisted compulsion and the still relevant ambivalence of his capture and ""trial."" unlike contemporary cinematic examples of the serial killer  beckert is not presented simply as a grotesque psychopath. nor is the issue of how society should deal with him at all clear-cut. to be sure  the gut-reaction of most film audiences is to root on the underworld mobsters and petty thieves who  beating the established authorities to their mutual quarry  capture beckert and bring him to a mock- formal trial whose conclusion is foregone. like many in america today  beckert's accusers are disinclined to listen to insanity pleas and would just as soon be rid of the ""monster"" in the surest way possible: a summary death penalty with as little fretting about legal rights as possible. considering the heinousness of beckert's crimes and the imperfections of a legal/medical system that could well turn him loose to kill again  this emotional response is hard to resist. yet m is by no means an endorsement of vigilantism - quite the contrary. through the unlikely rhetorical persuasions of beckert's unkempt ""court appointed"" defense attorney and beckert's own impassioned monologue  lang strongly implies that impatience with democratic judicial procedure and a paranoid eagerness to scapegoat others (guilty or not) in the name of order are symptomatic of the social hysteria breeding nazism in 1930s germany. that the ruthless killer who heads the underworld looks  dresses  and gestures like a gestapo officer is no accident. moreover  the letter ""m"" chalked on beckert's back by one of his pursuers not only stands for ""murderer"" but also alludes to god's marking of cain. while the popular misconception holds that the mark of cain symbolizes his evil  it in fact represents god's warning to cain's flawed fellow creatures not to mete out wrathful vengeance  but to leave justice in god's hands. translated into secular terms (and literally entering the shot from the top of the frame)  god's hands in m belong to the legitimate authorities that intervene at the last moment to arrest and try hans beckert ""in the name of the law."""
"metropolis is a film i really enjoyed; a must see! a cross between science fiction and film art  metropolis takes place in a futuristic city that's inhabitants are divided into an upper class and a worker class. the upper class is referred to as the ""head"" or brain that designed the city. the workers are the ""hand"" that built the city and are responsible for running the machines that keep it alive. freder  the son of the man who designed the city  meets a woman from the worker class  maria  and they fall in love. maria believes that the two classes need a mediator to help with communication between the classes. otherwise  they will forever be divided. could freder be that mediator? although metropolis was created in the 1930's  the film looks into issues still relevant in today's world such as the differences between socioeconomic classes and the question of if advancements in technology are better or worse for society.one thing great about this movie is the large cast of extras used to bring scenes to life. there are many scenes where there are so many extras! when first introduced to the workers' environment  i was instantly able to understand the day to day drudgery of the workers' life by seeing two large groups' trek to and from work. i also like how the movements of the individuals in the large group make statements. for example  when first viewing the workers operating the machine  their movements create a rhythm  and i was able to understand that the workers are seen as replaceable just like machine parts. the large cast of extras is especially effective when the workers become an angry mob intent on destroying the machines. it makes such an impact when the workers not only completely fill the large space  but more continue to stream in.i enjoyed the futuristic technology shown in this film such as video conferencing. it is hard to believe that this film was made in the 1930's and includes elements that have been staples in science fiction movies over the years. one scene shows a futuristic city with buildings that stretch to the sky and streets of varying levels full of bumper-to-bumper traffic. there is an android in this film who was created by an inventor  rotwang  who actually used his hand as a material in creating the android. this android is then transferred into a copy of maria  and she is able to sway the opinions of others. the inventor has the perfect ""mad scientist's lab"" fully equipped with the levers  test tubes and lightning seen when the rotwang is creating this copy. the special effects are pretty impressive in this scene  especially when the android's face fades into the face of maria.i think the acting in this movie is fantastic. especially that of brigitte helm. she plays two different characters and is able to effectively show the differences between the two by changing her facial expressions and body language pertaining to the personalities of each character.i definitely recommend this movie for one interested in seeing the future as it was imagined in the 1930's!"
"i doubt that i'd ever seen anything resembling a ""complete"" version of metropolis before  though certain of its scenes were familiar to me  if only as used and abused in such films as diane keaton's heaven (1987).  in any case  whatever i had seen before had nothing like the clarity and beauty of the kino restoration.  i expected to be distracted by the restoration's technique of concise written descriptions of missing sequences  but the narrative coherence that these provided was definitely worth it.  as ""exaggerated"" as the style of acting seems by contemporary standards  some performances  such as the master of the city  are amazingly nuanced and layered  and brigitte helm is stunning as both maria and her evil clone. the meticulous design of the film  the unerring camera placement and lang's muscular choreography of the crowd scenes are breathtaking. i'd thought of metropolis as a curiosity (""important"" = ""dull"") but now i've come to appreciate it as the seminal work it has always been."
wonderful picture mixes sentiment   drama   slapstick and pursuits in a winning combination . while walking the slums the tramp (charles chaplin) meets a baby left by an unfortunate woman (edna purviance who played several chaplin films)   including a note : ¨please love and care for this orphan child¨ . he then cares for an abandoned child   as charlie struggling to nurture the castoff illegitimate kid (jackie coogan who launched as the first child superstar) . the tramp has to face nasty cops   doctors and orphanage workers who want to carry the kid to county orphan asylum . as events put that relationship in jeopardy .this sassy picture packs slapstick   inter-weaving gags   melodrama   opulent victorian sensibility and a lot of laughters are guaranteed too . ¨the kid¨ is a culturally   historically   or aesthetically significant drama that originated a great influence of wide range . ordinary sentimentality is made available both by the balancing presence of harsh reality and chaplin's amusing grace of pantomimic skills . the sensitive drama is set amongst garbages   flophouses   a slum world described in erich von stroheim style . being accompanied by an adequate soundtrack   as the main theme from charles chaplin's score is based on a theme from pyotr ilyich tchaikovsky's 6th symphony . duo starring is frankly magnificent . as charlot's marvelous acting as a tramp who takes home an abandoned baby . nice acting by jackie cooper as streetwise orphan that launched him as major child star   and it's easy to see why . furthermore   agreeable edna purviance as unlucky mother   she acted in a lot of chaplin shorts and in a woman of paris: a drama of fate .the motion picture was masterfully directed and played by charles chaplin . the production company tried to cheat charles chaplin by paying him for this six-reel film what they would ordinarily pay him for two-reel film  about half a million dollars. chaplin took the unassembled film out of state until they agreed to the one-and-a-half million he deserved  plus half the surplus profits on rentals  plus reversion of the film to him after five years on the rental market. deemed to be chaplin's first real feature but he had made many shorts such as ¨the vagabond¨  ¨night at the show¨  ¨burlesque on carmen¨  ¨the immigrant¨ and ¨the circus¨ . chaplin subsequently would make a string of successful films such as ¨the gold rush¨  ¨city lights¨  ¨modern times¨  ¨the great dictator¨  ¨monsieur verdoux¨   ¨a king of new york¨ and his last movie ¨countess from hong kong¨.
"i've always thought there's a great beauty and poignancy to the best slapstick comedies  even unsentimental ones like keaton's ""the general"" or laurel and hardy's ""way out west."" the latter comedy has a scene where l&h perform a soft-shoe dance; it always brings me to tears. why? maybe physical comedy has the same kind of effect on me as a dance performance. both art forms are very expressive; the fact that i'm laughing doesn't dilute the emotional charge.one of many things that made chaplin a genius was his understanding of how close slapstick is to pathos already. why not marry the two things? that's what he did in some of his early short films  and that's what he does in this feature comedy. the little tramp finds an abandoned baby and raises him into boyhood. but the authorities find out and want to take little jackie (jackie coogan) away. meanwhile  the mother who abandoned him has since become a wealthy singer and doesn't know if she'll ever find out what became of him.jackie coogan (about five in this film)  with his charming manners  his talents as a mimic and his adeptness at physical comedy  is one of the all-time great child actors. want more evidence of chaplin's genius? coogan doesn't steal the film from him. this is true even though chaplin  as producer  star and director  makes every evident attempt to spotlight the boy's talents. coogan is even better here than he is in his own vehicles  like ""my boy"" and ""oliver twist.""chaplin's storytelling—even with the foolish sub-dickensian plot twists  such as jackie suddenly taking ill—deftly draws out the comedy and pathos for maximum effect. the individual scenes themselves are flawlessly constructed. the window-breaking scene  the flophouse scene  the dream sequence  the trying-to-get-rid-of-the-baby scene—they're perfect. chaplin's celebrated pantomimic skills are examples of storytelling in themselves.want me to criticize something? how about those thudding attempts to link the mother with jesus? but you know  i can't even complain about that. it's too sweetly naïve. and the movie as a whole is too good to allow us to sneer at the (very) few flaws.one important note: children love this movie. show it to them while they're young  and you'll make chaplin fans of them. and that's better than their becoming fans of almost anything that's being peddled to them."
"there is nothing new in green book. the same story has been told many times by the hollywood propaganda machine - improbable interracial friendships where the black man has to do all the emotional heavylifting in order to make our white protagonist slightly less racist. this ""friendship"" is ultimately portrayed as a mutual exchange of perspectives  where both sides manage to find common grounds with each other and come to understand their shared humanity.this is the archetype of the liberal humanist narrative  where power structures are conveniently ignored  and where political oppression and economic exploitation is reframed as nothing more than differences in culture and perspectives. as a result  according to this ideological narrative  the purpose of (liberal democratic) politics is reconciliation and compromise  as opposed to struggling for emancipation. the problems of structural violence and economic exploitation is reframed as individual prejudice and actions  which can be changed by respectability politics (""they go low  we go high"") and this bland humanist appeal to the oppressor's conscience.this is the deeply ideological narrative of green book and countless other stories  from driving miss daisy (1989) to the green mile (1999) to gran torino (2008) to the help (2011)  where the real problem - the irreducibly structural problem - is always erased in favor of a feel-good humanist drama that appeals primarily to middle-class white guilt. year after year  middle-class white audience can walk out of these hollywood films with a smug face  complacently declaring that they're glad that ""racism is finally over.""many people defend this film by saying that there's nothing inherently wrong with a comedic and light-hearted approach to serious social and historical problems. what they're saying is not wrong. in fact  some of the greatest works of cinema (and art in general) is about people finding humor and spirit in extreme positions of subjugation and poverty. yet these artworks depict poverty and oppression with acute social awareness and compassion  instead of flattening them into bland archetypes or straight-up ignoring them  which is what green book is guilty of.here we have two characters - an educated upper-class black man who is completely isolated from the culture and social conditions of his people  and a racist working-class white man who is portrayed as a misguided good-hearted person. the class dimension is never explicitly challenged or fully confronted  especially don's bourgeois sensibility. instead  the film focuses on how the two can learn from each other and become better persons - don becoming more down-to-earth and in touch with black popular music  and tony becoming less racist. yet the film never backs down from its pedagogy of respectability politics and never challenges its narrative of black exceptionalism. what does the film ultimately show about don and tony's friendship? it shows that only an exceptional  upper-class  respectable  talented black man can change the racist attitude of a white working-class man  and the film invites the audience to participate in its complacency  its classism  and its outrageous reductionism.the problem is not the humorous approach  but the absolutely reactionary myths about racism and racists that are perpetuated in this film  and the bourgeois complacency that this film engenders  which does nothing but reinforce the continued whitewashing and cooptation of the civil rights strategy  and the perpetuation of assimilationism  respectability politics  and reconciliationism."
"we loved green book along with the sold-out crowd who applauded loudly at the end. based on true story of piano virtuoso  don shirley's road trip through the south during the 60's  the film pays tribute to his genius and courage as a black man who tries hard to soar above the ugliness of the times. the elegant trappings of his home and his success as a concert pianist leave him arrogantly cold and lonely  but his life begins to change when he hires tony as his road trip driver. with a history as nightclub bouncer with mafia connections in new york  tony is the antithesis of don's perfection and their evolving relationship on the road makes the movie soar above the ordinary and become magical. viggo and ali in the main roles are remarkable  and it's funny and endearing to watch them discard stereotypes and discover their mutual humanity. what we liked best is the
movie teaches without preaching  it all unfolds through a myriad of natural moments between two great actors and a strong supporting cast. top all this off with a really good soundtrack  excellent direction and production values  and an audience that laughed out loud and vigorously applauded at the end...this one is a true 10!"
i can understand how one can adore this film. of course it had some very interesting ideas and tried to make certain points  but in the end it was a tonally indecisive mess. here are some of my main reservations: - the script is overexplanatory and relies too much on coincidence  while it plays down the consequences the main characters would have in real life  when acting nuts. i dare you to go burn a police station down  remain at the scene (regardless of the fact that you are virtually the only suspect) and tell me what happens afterwards. yes  i know mcdonagh would have argued that we shouldn't take the movie at face value  but there are too many -and too important- plot holes to forgive (and this is not a buddy cop comedy for god's sake). - in a cringeworthy flashback scene  we see the mother and daughter quarrel about angela going out  only for them to prove their precognitive skills (angela said she hoped she would get raped on the way  and mildred agreed with her). well  i'm positive there were more subtle ways to show why mildred is filled with remorse. - i thought rockwell's character to be too cartoonish at times. mcdonagh said that they had to cut a lot of material because there were tons of moments with rockwell's character that were too comedic  but there are still many way over the top moments left in the movie. - willoughby is portrayed as a genuinely decent guy. honestly  i don't get how can a sheriff let his racist officers deal with black people the way they did and still qualify as a good person. supposing he was an ignorant  illiterate redneck  i would be much more willing to excuse this kind of behaviour.
three billboards outside ebbing  missouri is a dark comedy that has an a-list cast with names like frances mcdormand  woody harrelson  sam rockwell  john hawkes  and peter dinklage. it centers around mildred hayes  a woman whose daughter was raped and killed  and who believes that the local police have not done enough about it. in reaction  she erects three billboards outside of her town that send a message to the sheriff about the state of the investigation.writer/director martin mcdonagh (seven psychopaths  in bruges) has outdone himself with this one. in my opinion  if this isn't one of the top oscar contenders come awards season  then hollywood has officially lost its mind.basically everything about this film works: from the acting  to the writing  to the direction. mcdormand gives the performance of her career here  giving us humor through all the pain clearly shown on her face. rockwell also gives his best performance here as a cop who isn't that bright and is more than a little racist. three billboards outside ebbing  missouri is probably the most unpredictable film of the year  and that's coming from a year that includes films like baby driver and logan. there are scenes where you think that you know where the plot is going  but then midway through it completely flips the script. for the entire run-time of this film  i was invested. it has the perfect run-time; it ends exactly when it needs to and there is not a scene that feels out of place. it seems like one of the hardest things to do in film nowadays is to balance comedy and drama. however  this movie does it effortlessly. each scene has just the right amount of comedy and drama  and sometimes  despite the fact that you're laughing  it's easy to forget that jokes are being made.also  the message that this film gives off resonates very powerfully with you after the film finishes. it makes you see the good side in humanity  despite our flaws. no character in this film is a cliché one-dimensional shell of a person. everybody has a reason for being there  which is more than some films recently have offered.three billboards outside ebbing  missouri is easily one of the best and most enjoyable films of 2017  and it will make you laugh  cry  and think all in one sitting. there are not any clear flaws with this film that i can find  but i am still searching.i give three billboards outside ebbing  missouri an a+.
very solid original story  awesome visual style and great writing. all it takes. on the contrary  reinventing 30 year old cartoons and doubling down on puritan stuff does not help.this film deserves broader recognition - best christmas catroon in a long long time
at first i thought it would be dumb  but omg it was amazing! the story was awesome (i won't give any spoilers) and there were parts that made me laugh so hard and parts that made me cry. i don't usually cry during movies  but i'm sitting here writing this review with tears in my eyes. i think it is going to become a new movie to watch every christmas with my family!
drishyam was first made in malyalam and then recently it was made in tamil as papanasam and in telugu and other languages as well. director is nishikant kamat who gave us mumbai meri jaan(2008) and force(remake of kaakha kaakha) the film almost just replicates the original drishyam almost scene to scene with a few minor changes  like the religion in the original mohanlal was a catholic  here ajay is a hindu(thankfully no artificial catholic character)  also in place of going for a retreat there go for a ashram trip. the film is set in goa  thankfully no focus on beaches and bars.etc yet there are some stereotypes like the character of martin who runs martins corner  he offers the cop a beer at breakfast. but this can be ignored. the film keeps you on the edge though it does lag behind compared to the original yet it is watchabledirection is decent  though most of the film is a copypaste job music is decentajay devgan though not to be compared to mohanlal kamal hassan does his role in his style and is good in his role shriya saran however doesn't suit the role  as she looks too young to be ajay's wife and daughter of ishita dutta(sister of tanushree dutta) as the latter is hardly 8 years younger to her. yet she is okay. tabu is admirable in the role of a tough cop  rajat kapoor is exelmpary. ishita dutta is superb though she looks older for the role  mrinal jadhav is good  prathamesh parab as ajay's assistant makes a good hindi debut. kamlesh sawant is superb as always  rishabh chadda is superb as sam rest are all okay
i thoroughly enjoyed this movie inspite of seeing the japanese movie not the novel. ajay was brilliant. he got into the skin of the character. he looked like an ordinary guy. he lost all his muscles. even the kind of shirts he wore with full sleeves did justice to the role. tabu acted well too. i think she should settle down as she was looking old. the movie is something very different from your regular bollywood trash. i have seen many korean  japanese  french  hollywood thrillers. and drishyam was a good drama/ thriller too. i am *uckin' fed up with majority bollywood stars and movies. even if the script doesn't require  the hero is showing off abs and dancing skills. majority of 'em is filled with vulgar item songs which is getting monotonous. people who enjoy thrillers should check out the treatment  confessions of a murder  bereavement and malevolence  marshland  poker night  13 sins  the secret in their eyes  the shrine  freeway killer  ittefaq (borrowed from signposts to murder )  adam green's spiral and frozen  the keeper of lost causes  cell 211. people who expect item songs  hero bashing goons ala matrix style action  hero showing dancing skills  hero flaunting abs  the same *uckin' monotonous bollywood obnoxious films should be with care before watching this film.
"it was one of the best films i've ever watched due it's hologram of simplicity and depth at the same time. the soundtrack that was used during the film was really deep with its pauses  reflecting the unknowness that cover the human nature and at the same time tapping into the original human good will but not original sin. watching it reminds how the world doesn't matter and most of our values that we have created are only to protect the ""us"" from the ""them"" by engaging in a mercantilist kinds of way. what is religion? who is religious? what is war? does it matter to live? and so on are only parts of the questions that were put forward in the movie. the theme of death and religion is approached with eyes of a simple farmer living in a stranded village where the war for ivo  to put it in his words  "" nobody's war"""
this film is flawless and one of the highlights of the montreal world film festival 2014. it also was recognized with many international prizes in europe  north america and even israel. it captures the incoherence and inhumanity of war from the point of view of innocent civilians and of dehumanized soldiers. the pace and plot are crisp  compact and conscious-elevating with a spectacular  yet simple screenplay. the cinematography and music match and enhance the emotional and philosophical human drama. the acting from the all-male cast is poignant and powerful in its restraint. zaza urushadze's text comes to life like a play in this sometimes claustrophobic confine which only heightens the inherent tension between the protagonists. the directing does however balance this with the sad beauty of rural abkhazia conflict zone. the simple sets set the mood and this movie is shooting for the moon.alexander kuranov returns as the editor after teaming up with zaza urushadze for the excellent multiple story three houses (2008) and gets every cut and emotion right. the dialogue  like the film  is raw  unpredictable  mysterious and profound. it brings you the very core of humanity's hopes and fears. the theme of pointless war has rarely been portrayed so perfectly. it surpasses even seminal south korean the front line (2011) and does so in a intellectual and emotionally effective way. beyond that it is a human drama about people stuck in a conflict and how they decide to deal with it and each other. is there a glimpse of hope or some guidelines we can learn from?be sure that i will be looking for zaza's previous and next work. this is cinema at it's best.
"""then there was the whole concept of coal mining  which is a culture unto itself  the most dangerous occupation in the world  and which draws and develops a certain kind of man."" martin c. smithmanoj bajpai wants revenge on tigmanshu dhulia who had treacherously killed his father. sometimes there comes a story which has an epic kind of sweep. spanning generations  introducing several characters  all caught up in empire building  love  lust and enimity. there isn't much point to them  the protagonists aren't clearly defined  the storyline meandering  their lives entwined in the events that befell the nation and the small town that the story inhabits. set in the backdrop of wasseypur  a small part of dhanbad  capital of india's coal belt  numerous characters come and go. india gains independence  emergency is imposed  coal mining is first unionized and later nationalized. however  the story  at its core remains about tigmanshu's star rising ever higher and manoj building his own empire from humble origins  while seeking revenge.there are times when you wish things would happen quicker. that there were less characters. or that there was a point to some of them  who are introduced to either only die or shine bright for a few frames before being forgotten. the environment is beautifully captured  including the lingo  the mannerisms whether it's the abject despair of the poor mine worker  condemned to live his life in the black shafts. the bestiality of the butcher  as he hacks away at his meat. the cowardice of the cops. the empty bravado of the minister's goons. or the naked lust as hungry men eye their next catch  the woman to slake their base desires  even as the wife lies at home  pregnant. however  there are several things which let the film down. for a film set in the coal belt  we see very little of it. apart from one memorable scene where  caked in the black coaldust  a few men fight for their lives and another where coals water absorption properties are highlighted  there is too little was about the black mineral and much more made of ancillary businesses. national events of importance are also given short shrift or brushed over  their impact shown quickly  transitions happening smoothly rather than in real life where each change creates havoc in such a tiny eco-system. great camera work  flawless performances  several one-liners and very catchy music keep you engaged  though  as our two key protagonists slug it out and religion comes in  with different sects of muslims engaging in war amongst each other. the story moves forward with a godfather-esque gait  a kind of glacial majesty  in stops and starts  not always making sense. but then  isn't that how real life is ?"
just saw the screening at the sydney film festival. its definitely one of the best hindi movies ever made. direction  screenplay  narration  acting  music  cinematography  everything about this movie is top notch. anurag kashyap is truly the best at whatever he does. you wont even feel the length of 5 hours and 20 minutes. manoj bajpai's has proved once again that he is the powerhouse of acting. not one scene is out of order and everything is properly explained with no questions unanswered. dialogues are very sharp and as close to reality as it can get. the opening sequence in itself is a masterpiece. the way its scripted and executed is just mind blowing. all the bloodshed keeps getting more and more innovative. its one of those movies that will always be mentioned everywhere whenever someone talks about the indian cinema.
"""el secreto de sus ojos"" hit me with unspeakable strength. i didn't expect to like it so much  so i owe a review to those in analysis measures before seeing it or those interested in some opinion.first off  campanella works with flawless effort all of the technical aspects of the film. it even starts with a double exposure effect  mixed with some sad shots of a beautiful buenos aires that hints the spectacle ahead of us. one shot especially  from a chopper in a soccer field edited with a crane shot is breathtaking. nothing to envy from hollywood upper class.but the main strength of the movie comes from the powerful narrative dominion director campanella has over characters  spaces and silences. many moments are coldly tense  scary and very  very intense. this crossover from genres by campanella couldn't have been better. crime stories often fall in common places  this one relies on the fragile psychological state of the audience to draw all of it's intense dialog  acting and scenes.i cannot stop recommending it  argentina can open it's market with movies such as this. it has many  many memorable moments  it interwines comedy perfectly and it is doubtful you will instantly forget it  as it is so well constructed. see it if you can!"
this is quite frankly an astonishing film. one that fills your entire array of senses and sensitivities  and the praise from argentine reviewers here is 100 percent justified. ricardo darín turns in another majestic performance as a buenos aires court employee who is fiercely affected by the rape and murder of a young girl in 1974  a tragedy that dominates his life. overlapping this theme is the powerfully sensual but never physical relationship between darín and his superior  the investigating judge played by the superb soledad villamil. the connection between the two is electric. it's a pity this film cannot easily transcend the language barrier  if it was an english-language film of the same quality it would already be hailed as a masterpiece. the blending of tragedy  love  violence and humour is brilliant  and the comedy dialogue fantastic. one scene where ricardo darín is balled out for having searched an old lady's house is priceless in terms of comic timing and delivery. a wonderful performance also from guillermo francella as the court clerk with a drinking problem  in fact the secondary acting is all first-class. the camera-work is impressive  especially the swoop down into the football stadium and the closeups  and the script is also superb. argentina has nominated the film as its candidate for best foreign film at the oscar's  it deserves to walk it.
very difficult to make a successful sports movie here we have the inside and outside the ring battle between 2 estranged brothers who ultimately go head to head in a million dollar ufc fight an alcoholic father adds spice to this family feud based drama with a surprisingly good script.the rise of tom hardy is further witnessed here with an excellent account of a war torn brokenhearted soldier poised for self destruction an excellent cast around hardy are equally impressive as this story unfolds in the foreground of the ufc phenomenon.
please don't read this if you don't want the ending given away.i've noticed a lot of people complaining that the ending spoils the film and is clichéd because the underdog and not the better fighter wins.i'm not suggesting that my interpretation is the right one but my view is somewhat different than the one some people hold. it is perfectly logical to point out that brendan had hard fights to get to the final and that he would probably have been exhausted and that tommy has had a much easier route.however  the point is that he made that route easier because of his rage. tommy is only the more destructive force because of that. his demons are driving him on because he is lost. he cannot or will not reach out to connect with his father or brother. the point is that the dam is broken when he sees his father in the hotel room raging against ahab. this is deeply symbolic. i think you are meant to draw the connection with ahab who was driven by his own rage with the rage of the father which destroyed his family to the rage which tommy now feels. even though he is drunk it is no coincidence that his father refers to tommy as ahab and bellows at him to stop the ship. at the point that tommy takes him in his arms and holds him he begins the healing process but loses what makes him such a formidable fighter. thus he is simply unable to blow his brother away in the way that he has done to every other opponent.the other crucial point (and you would have to be a younger brother to fully get this one) is that tommy doesn't really want to beat his brother at that point. he needs to know that his brother loves him and perhaps that he regrets not reaching out to him when they were younger. the fact that he taps out only at the point when brendan says he loves him is significant as is the fact that he breaks down in the corner before the final round. had he still been carrying his rage he would surely rather have been rendered unconscious than submit.in other words  for me it was the perfect ending and the more you think about the film the more profound it seems.all in my view of course. which could be a load of old rubbish.
first  i know many who read this will not take the time to research what i'm saying to see that it is true and further  many won't have the ability to see it even if they did. so  i know this review will be thumbed down by those who don't like the hard truths in life but this movie (or should i say novel by dennis lehane) was a nice piece of plagiarism based upon a 1920 silent film called the cabinet of dr. caligari.the same basic plot exists in both as well as the exact same twist ending. the lead character investigates an insane asylum and tries to put clues together to figure out the mystery surrounding the place but as we near the end  we learn that the lead character isn't there to investigate anything. he's an inmate there who has invented much of what he was investigating as part of his coping mechanism.shutter island would have been a good movie if it hadn't ripped off the cabinet of dr. caligari so blatantly. lehane obviously knew that the old movie was in the public domain but instead of telling the viewers that it was based on that movie  they just pass it off as his (and/or scorseesi's idea). that  my friends  is the definition of plagiarism.i don't recommend this whatsoever for this reason. it is a shame and lehane should be called on it but who will do it? too much $ to be made reheating the old dishes and calling them made from scratch.watch the cabinet of dr. caligari (it's on y o u t u b e if you want to compare the two and see that what i'm saying is 100% correct).i almost never write reviews but this time  i had to.
shutter island is the story of teddy daniels  a u.s. federal marshal sent to the island with his partner chuck aule to search for the disappearance of a patient. each scene provides a turn against their leads and compels them to look for more whilst searching in places we couldn't comprehend  including their minds. leonardo dicaprio and mark ruffalo feed off each other and supply great performances for their characters as expected  but some of the other characters whose names are riveted on the posters or marquees are sensational as well. the two that stuck out to me most were ben kingsley (dr. cawley) and michelle williams (dolores  teddy's wife)  each of whom brought so much dramatics and new questions to the movie  developing plot twists and controversy. i don't think this film would be the same without them.this is also a film i would recommend seeing a second time. in fact  it is even better the second time. all those pieces of that puzzle you didn't catch the first time  you will the second. you see  we as the audience are first put in the shoes of teddy. the second? well  without giving too much away  lets just say you are put in someones else's shoes entirely during the second viewing. shutter island. a film that will make you question your own sanity. a film that will leave you breathless. a film that has re-ignited the thriller genre. a film that will leave you  and the main character  searching for answers.
"sadly  there aren't enough superlatives in the english language with which to laud up  the latest offering from the folks at disney/pixar. this is quite simply the best movie of any genre to emerge thus far this year. no small praise considering how i've long been adverse to ""kids movies""  pegging them as being shallow  vapid  and simplistic - a personal preconception which pixar mercifully shattered with 2004's the incredibles and 2008's wall-e  which proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that for all their acclaim as an animation studio  they are equally brilliant story tellers up tells the story of carl fredricksen (voiced by ed asner)  who as a child meets ellie  later to become the love of his life. carl and ellie find they share a common dream – to one day visit paradise falls  a mysterious tropical oasis in south america made famous in vintage newsreels chronicling the exploits of explorer/adventurer charles muntz (christopher plummer). life  however  manages to get in the way as the two grow up  get married  experience the pain of miscarriage  and eventually grow old  so much so that father time catches up on ellie  leaving carl a widower. all of this is conveyed with little dialog in a masterful sequence that had the audience  old and young alike  sniffling throughout.if you're thinking this isn't the usual stuff you see in ""kids movies"" you're right. but all credit is due to pixar and the directorial and writing team of pete docter and bob peterson for realizing that children aren't idiots  and can handle complex  often tragic stories  if conveyed in the proper manner. it's a refreshing change from the over-protective mentality that once saw all hints of violence edited out of warner bros/looney tunes cartoons.in up  characters bleed  there's implied murder  and it's all counter-balanced with some of the most delightfully twisted humor that's as inspired as anything the zucker brothers ever came up with. the story literally had me careening from being misty-eyed to laughing heartily  frequently in the span of minutes.faced with forced relocation to a retirement home  carl opts for one final gambit  to fly his house down to paradise falls with the aid of a multitude of helium-filled balloons affixed to the roof of his house. along for the ride is russell (jordan nagai)  a wilderness scout seeking to add a merit badge to his collection. eventually the duo are complimented by dug (voiced by co-director and writer bob peterson) a dopey derelict dog equipped by the now aged muntz with a translator collar that converts dog thoughts to english.like wall-e  up manages to imbue its characters with depth and humanity  while at the same time tell a story that is mature  delightful  and most of all  terrifically funny. in an era when hollywood seems only capable of re-boots and do-overs  up is not merely a refreshing stroke of original brilliance  it is likely the best movie you will see all year.... or until pixar emerges with their next effort."
this film is possibly one of the best animated films of all time as it tells an emotional moving story while being funny. as i said the emotion in this film is full of heart and even though i didn't cry it will make most people cry. the characters in this are perfect even if it is a small character like ellie or big character like carl everybody gets so much development even charles muntz the villain of the film is also given development  even more than some superhero films nowadays. also this film has comedy some pixar films now just want to make you cry but in the 2000s they had mix of sad and funny moments. so overall this film is as close to perfect as an animated film can get  it is has a mix of emotions it is funny and sad when it needs to be it has so much heart and the characters are perfect. this film in my opinion is the best pixar film.
the last few scorsese pics left me a little disappointed. i had begun to think marty had become a 'gun for hire' and that his brilliance may have been spent (his earlier works were some of the best movies ever made). i attended a screening of the wolf of wall street this evening  and was expecting to be unimpressed. i am happy to say i was completely blown away. this pic is marty at his best. i laughed  i cringed  i related (with fond memories as well as a bit of guilt) and i totally believed every unbelievable moment. a good book  a great screenplay and a delightful cast were formed and molded into what i believe should get scorsese a best director oscar  and likely a best picture award for the movie. leo dicaprio has grown into a versatile actor and his creation of this super hero dirtbag's roller coaster ride in this crazy (true) story is really honest and delightfully entertaining. jonah hill pulled out all the stops too and this is definitely his best work. thank you mr. scorsese for delivering the goods so brilliantly!
"this film is every definition of the word ""impeccable."" scorcese's fantastic storytelling ability mixed with phenomenal acting from dicaprio  hill and the rest of the cast makes for an awesome combination. the film is never boring and gives you a glimpse into the life of a man who had everything in the world only to have it taken away."
"first off  i'd like to say that i have enjoyed most all of pta's films. i loved boogie nights  thought magnolia was an ambitious  but not great picture  and thoroughly enjoyed punch- drunk love. i  like many others have eagerly awaited paul thomas anderson's latest film  there will be blood. in fact  i drove almost 120 miles and waited 2-3 hours in line to see it  as that was the closest showing of it. i bought into all the hype  read almost every review  watched any and all interviews of it that i could  expecting a ""masterpiece"" as so many imdbers put it. people even had the audacity to say it's one of the best films of the decade. some big words and shoes for a film to fit. nevertheless  after the wait  i found myself disappointed and terribly bored with this film. the movie's pacing and editing was so slow and too long (nearly 3 hours)  i felt that the editor should have had another much needed run in the cutting room. for instance  certain shots in a scene went on forever as the camera stays with a character for 5 min or more  never changing angles  creating a needlessly slow pace. there were many scenes with little to no dialog adding another dull layer. now i appreciate films with silence that present cinematic art ( ""3-iron"" and ""spring  summer  fall  winter...and spring""  two movies that are nearly all silence) yet here it granted the film unevenness. people are claiming this film had beautiful cinematography  yet i fail to see what was so unique. perhaps the theater i was at had an inexperienced projectionist  bad print or something  but the shots  lighting  and composition were rather dull and the camera movements uninteresting. i mean how hard is it to shoot wide-angle barren landscapes and campfire scenes and follow actors with steadicam/tracking scenes? although this wasn't a stylized movie  rather an attempt to take you into the 19th century  i thought the cinematography was mediocre at best. i've seen better work from robert elswit and other dps. worse than mediocre however  is the music/soundtrack  which was so obnoxious and used out of place  that it just may have worsened the viewing experience. the horror-like  intense and unnerving score that was mixed way too loud in the soundtrack  doesn't even seem to match the images or the story. the music isn't ""bad""  but it does not fit well. the music  which attempted to create tension among the characters exemplifying greed and corruption  seemed extremely forced and vexing. here is this rather slowly cut/paced movie displaying an ugly landscape or early america undeveloped showcasing a man being slowly corrupted  scored side-by-side with this imposing  experimental  enormous  horror-like score that was woefully out of sync with the film and apparently wanted to call attention to itself  not assist the story. acting... well  although there is praise left and right for daniel day lewis and paul dano  i felt both performances were lackluster  paul dano's being much worse. there were many times that i felt like dano was just reading from a script and not embodying the character  for instance  the first time we are introduced to him  his lines are weak and artificial with strange speech pauses and insipid facial expressions. ddl was also nothing special. his accent was  well... certainly not mind-blowing  and didn't make me think of anything uniquely ""american"" as that was what he was supposedly trying to portray. in many scenes he was overacting and dano was underacting  or vice versa. i couldn't get into the two personality types as they were undeveloped. although the audience is supposed to dislike dd lewis  i didn't care for any of the characters and completely lost interest in the film about 40 min to an hour into it. dd lewis is a great actor and that may be an understatement  but he certainly did not shine in this picture. yet at the same time  he may have been the only redeemable thing in this movie. i can only assume that since pta is known for giving minimal direction and following his scripts closely (he has stated this during commentaries of his films) the acting was flawed and pulse nearly-dead  due to the weak script/adaptation. there were some major/minor holes in this film  but i didn't care. i was too bored  and couldn't care about any underlying tones of greed and religion since the characters neither really embodied either very well. some characters appear  some disappear never to be seen again  certain scenes that were supposed to be climactic and intense came off as comedic (the audience i was with  laughed a great deal during these scenes) and i wondered if that was the way pt anderson intended it  or it being the audience i sat with. i don't know. for example  during the final scene where ddl and dano's ""discussion"" turns into a near fight  the scene comes off as if it were slapstick and had the audience busting out in laughs.in summary  this film was a major let down for me as i had high hopes for it  and was a fan of all of pta's films. the film's execution  writing  and direction was empty and flawed  resulting in an uneven  and painfully boring film. i suppose there are different strokes for different folks  but the film really stinks."
people did not like this movie for a simple reason: too negative. i can understand that this movie is so depressing in so may ways. what it shows that big fish eats litte fish and none of us want to think about that anymore than most of us experience it in our daily life. it shows the battle between the evangelicals and the corporate business man. or maybe even the battle between evangelicals of today and the non-religious people or atheists of today. even worse is that this movie shows that religious people  priests are or can be as bad as a corrupt oil man. maybe why people did not like this movie is because it might have offended them. especially paul dano playing the priest. both daniel day lewis and paul dano are wrong and too extreme on their opinions. people are able to accept this. what people cannot accept is though that these same extremities and same misguided opinions from both characters are very much true in that they are heavily believed still today. not all christains are like paul dano's character and not all business man are like daniel day lewis's character but many are like them. that is the world we live in.now is their any alternative or positive side? the answer is yes and that is h.w. the son of daniel plainview(daniel day lewis). he epitomizes hope. he shows that despite being deaf and having a father who uses him as a ploy for better business he can still break free of the chains that he is being tied down by. what separates h.w. from the residents and evangelists of little boston? the difference is that he and his father are educated and they are not. that is how daniel plainview is able to manipulate and cheat them the sunday family  even eli sunday(paul dano) the priest and preacher of little boston. from what h.w. sees and experiences he sees that much of what is around him is just wrong. he uses his experience that he had gained as a kid to break free of the corruption and chaos that could have taken over him. that is one aspect of the education i'am talking about: our experiences and understanding of what is happening around us. now to get to the technical aspects of there will be blood. it is just truly spectacular in every way. first off the acting was amazing. daniel day lewis gave arguably the best performance of his career playing daniel plaiview or ever since movies began to be made. he freaked me out and probably shocked many people. his thirst for power and money was at such a high level that it made me wonder about what people are really capable of. the deceiving  the greed  the thirst for power and the every man for himself attitude actually looked more real than ever to me. without daniel day lewis i don't think this movie could have achieved what it has. paul dano gave a great performance as eli sunday though people tend to disagree. i think he gave a great portrayal of an extremist evangelical priest of how he himself had his own thirst for power and how he was more blasphemous then respectful and gracious to god then how you would expect a priest to be. how could people not be shocked by these two characters  i was myself.why was the music for this movie not liked. i thought this was among the top five musical scores i have ever heard. the music perfectly gave you the feeling of the corruption and deception setting into the movie. it perfectly intertwined with the rest of the movie as the movie itself was ever growingly becoming more and more chaotic and surreal. probably too shocking though.paul thomas anderson i believe gave the best directing job of the year. he was able to show the oil fields and its processes  the rise of an oil man  the way everyone can be bought even a priest and the hope that h.w. represented. this movie was never boring and it was as stunning of a directing job as daniel day lewis gave as a performance for his role in this movie. the intensity of this movie was as high as a movie could possibly be and some of the credit for this has to go to the director. the cinematography and the music seemed to intertwine perfectly like the rest of the movie. it gave the sense of the time period and as said before the greed  deception  etc. the cinematography did not just give you a negative feeling but a feeling as if what you are watching is real.you should not like this movie just because of the great technical achievements as you should not for any movie but for what it says and how it says it. i'm not even sure if you should enjoy this movie in general but you should not be blinded by your opinions. i applaud you whoever out there who can somewhat understand this movie and get past the lying and deceiving we do to ourselves. this movie really shows the humanity of human beings. why is this rated-r?it has so many intense scenes that if you get inside this movie it is truly haunting. now maybe this movie was too powerful for many people  it was probably even shocking for realists. maybe though its not that surprising that so many people don't like this movie because the truth hurts. not the truth about corruption or about people but the truth about ourselves.
pan's labyrinth is a moving film about grace in the midst of evil. it can be appreciated on at least two levels. a little girl and her mother move to the countryside of spain to be with the mother's new husband in the final days of her pregnancy. the girl  ophelia comes across a labyrinth in which she meets a faun. he gives her three tasks to complete by the full moon to prove she is the lost daughter of the king of the underworld. this movie shows her doing the tasks and dealing with the complications of the mother's pregnancy. it is an extremely moving story of a soul's journey to its father. as you watch the movie you can see that the cinematography  especially the lighting  corresponds with the meaning and outcome of the movie. pan's labyrinth is a movie with great spiritual insight on who we are and who our father is. unquestionably one of the greatest films i have ever seen. i recommend this movie  as it gives a glimpse of the deeper meaning of the world.
i saw the film at frightfest in london a couple of days ago  and was pretty well sure i'd be seeing something special - but i ended up seeing a film that is downright extraordinary. brutal but beautiful  magical yet earthy  it has a remarkable cast  with standout performances all round.a special mention must go to sergi lopez  whose 'captain vidal' is indeed one of the most sadistic film creations ever seen. yet he manages to make the audience understand why he is the way he is ... an astounding performance. maribel verdu's quiet but rebellious housekeeper is one of the strongest female roles i've seen in many a year  and she is supported by a wealth of talent. young ivana baquero is surprisingly self-assured as 12-year-old ofelia  and i especially liked her almost alice-like approach to the magical creatures she encounters in the labyrinth. the icing on this warped fairy tale is doug jones  who gives a towering performance - and in this case literally  as well as figuratively - as the guardian of the labyrinth  a faun  full of grace and charm and latent menace. although dubbed  his spanish is perfect (jones speaks not a word of the language)  and his physical presence is incredibly powerful as his character teases  cajoles and harries ofelia to fulfil her tasks. he also plays the devastatingly creepy and disgusting 'pale man' - a creature that almost equals vidal in his terrorising habits.but the cast is just one facet of this gloriously photographed film  with javier navarrete's hauntingly simple score weaving itself into the fabric of a film perfectly edited and written. the brutality of post-civil war spain contrasts with the world of magic to which ofelia is drawn  yet everywhere she goes she has choices to make. in fact the film is about choices  good and bad  and one discovers that no matter how desperate a situation becomes  a choice is always available - although that choice may mean one's death. the film is violent - very violent  but each moment of brutality  although graphic  has a purpose - nowhere is it gratuitous.i loved it - as i knew i would - and if the oscar voters don't give this film at least a nod for best foreign language film next year  then i will know that they have lost any sense of reason or comprehension. because this film is truly a masterpiece  and del toro's greatest work to date.
"i was a fan of the ""v for vendetta"" graphic novel  and alan moore disinheriting the film was a bit discouraging. but he's always been a little crazy. the film version is everything i could have possibly hoped for - gripping  chilling  intense  exciting  heartbreaking. it gets moore's music if not his exact words; elements are slightly different  subplots removed. but the idea - as v himself would be so proud to say - remains the same.the plot is surprisingly complex and nuanced  and i don't want to give anything more away than the previews already have. suffice it to say that a masked anarchist (voiced by hugo weaving) must save a young woman (natalie portman) during his attempt to expose corruption in the government. weaving is perfectly cast  using his formidable physicality and imposing voice to give gravitas to the insanity of the character. portman has gone from child to teen star and is finally emerging as a talented  adult actress following her oscar-nominated turn in ""closer"". here  she gives her best performance to date as the orphan evey. john hurt is characteristically impressive as the enigmatic government leader  and stephen rea gives a wonderful supporting turn as the police inspector charged with finding v - before it's too late.the wachowski brothers' former protégé  james mctiegue  takes on the directing duties here and helms an enormously impressive first feature  using every trick in the book in a manner reminiscent of his mentors' breakout hit ""the matrix"". unlike ""the matrix""  mctiegue allows the story to be more of a focus than the action  and as a result the film is a tense and emotional thriller  with outbursts of spectacularly filmed and choreographed action. showing more maturity and restraint than the wachowskis  mctiegue doesn't show off  and his trickery isn't self conscious. when slow-motion overtakes a late action sequence  it seems as natural as breathing. the late cinematographer adrian biddle (the film is dedicated to his memory) does an outstanding job  oscar-nominated dario marianelli's score is a fantastic accompaniment to the piece  and the visual effects are astonishing  terrifying  and deeply moving  especially in the climatic moments in trafalgar square.with solid acting  great action  and fantastic technical wizardry  it sounds just like another ""matrix""-style ripoff. but the biggest difference in ""v"" is that it is a story of real ideas - not a fantastic  science fiction creation  but a genuine examination of the human condition. the power of fear takes center stage here - the fear of war  of disease  of famine. fear is a basic human nature  and has been exploited as a weapon - a method of control - for centuries. and for those who would use it  a masked man waits in the shadows to carry out your sentence. the verdict? vengeance. ""v for vendetta"" is a must-see.10/10"
i watch this film every 5th of november without fail.
"**** spoilers ***** had read my share of decidedly mixed reviews  but nothing had prepared me for this.i was shocked  staring back at the screen in disbelief last night at my local multiplex.my quibbles: 1. the script - too much going on  too many layers. voice-over  one strand of the narrative set in the past  another set in the present. somehow  all the different elements don't gel together all that well. something that was obvious when bhagat singh  chandrasekar azad et al end up moving along to khalbali blaring on the soundtrack.events happen rather randomly in a disjointed kind of way and my jaw hit the floor when the following happened  for me  big wtf moments: - aamir suddenly deciding that ""drastic measures have to be taken"" and that to kill the politico would be the best thing to do  that  even though they had established that sensibilities had changed and that people -- young people esp. -- are no longer as politically engaged in as they were say 80-odd years ago.even though it had been foreshadowed by having karan's father coincidentally (and very conveniently) be involved with the russian armament companies  madhavan's death came off as a cheap plot device.the killing actually takes place. wtf? - they hijack the radio station. the dj makes the dramatic announcement about the killing and concludes with "" and now roobaroo!""  and the actual upbeat song plays on the soundtrack  clashing with all the dramatics that came before i was dying.karan killing his father  because ""it's the only way out""  again  wtf? - ajay's mother slipping into a coma (!!!) and symbolically giving signs of life once the ""deed"" is done  again  creaky plot mechanics imo.now  mind you  i'm not decrying the fact that they were yearning for change. i empathize  nay  i sympathize with and fully subscribe to revolutionary movements across the globe and their ideals  but here  i just felt that in the context of the film  the actions that follow ajay's (madhavan) death  were unwarranted and unnecessary  and that  surely  there could have been other ways  peaceful ways  to bring about change. as it is  it came off as the kind of empty-headed liberal ideology that gives conservative elements in governments around the world ammunition to dismiss such movements as ""hotheaded"".maybe my above comments show how little i know about indian politics and as one character says in the film  ""the corruption"" rooted in it.still  i had no sympathy for any of the characters  who quite frankly  came off as idiots imho. all they did was dance around and do nothing significant  with aamir's character the most reprehensible of the lot  for he was the eldest and should have known better. not holding down a job  living off his mother  and hanging out with his friends on campus. was his character a ""model"" to follow? i have my doubts about that. ""be a rebel"" the soundtrack intones hhmmmm.the second half feels rushed  as if the screenwriter was going through the motions and trying to hit as many plot points as possible in the most mechanical fashion.2. alice's character someone please explain what kind of documentary that was she was making? a reenactment of these revolutionaries' lives shot on the cheap with a dv camera? sure looked sleek on screen what with the sepia cast  thousands of extras  etc lol. guess that budget of hers inflated as it went along and what kind of documentary was that anyway? another problem is that when the film starts  she is the central figure in the plot. midway through  her and the whole documentary storyline are discarded. talk about consistency. also  that aamir love interest subplot goes nowhere.my biggest problem though is why is she  another gora  the agent of change? why is it  that she  a white woman  is the one who rouses the indians to consciousness about their life and their lack of engagement? that's what made me most angry actually. she  a foreigner  comes to india  and educates the local youths about their own history. how can people not be outraged by that? i found the idea insidious.technically  the movie is okay.acting-wise  everyone from alice payton  to aamir  to siddarth  to soha ali khan (surprise!)  etc are very good though i feel om puri was wasted in his small role.they should have done away with the songs. they just get in the way most of the time. exception is the luka chuppi used to rousing effects during ajay's funeral.the movie fails as an ode to youth  friendship  etc and at times i felt the filmmakers were trying to emulate some of the scenes and feelings one found in dil chahta hai with the characters reveling in the lush fields and making the most of a time they know will never happen again misses the mark though and that second half almost erases all the good things in the first very disappointing and off the mark!"
the movie released today after a lot of hype and controversies. i went to see it expecting it to be a little different from the standard escapist fantasies churned out by the indian film industry (of which i am not a fan). what i got was something so very different from what i had envisioned. the humor the clichés  the nonchalance of youth  the culture  religion politics... are all there and the best part is that it works. the storyline though is stretched a bit (we indians need that) but the message is loud and clear. throughout the movie a great sense of humor is maintained.the performances are all excellent. i have given this movie a rating of 10 solely on the basis of the originality of the story. while this movie is definitely not kurasawa or satyajit ray  it is one of the few movies from india which i feel will appeal to both the mainstream and discerning audiences. a movie not to be missed.
finally  after the previous 2 outings of the caped crusader  the batman franchise is back on track. having been a big comic collector over the years and a long time fan of the dark knight  i was especially disappointed by 'forever' and 'batman and robin'. to me  these film lost the essence of what drives bruce wayne to do what he does and turned batman into more of a pop star than misunderstood hero.thankfully though  nolan has gone back to the roots of the character  portraying a confused and angry bruce wayne  who ultimately rises to become gotham's greatest champion. don't expect to see loads of shots of batman in this film though. it is the story of wayne and focuses mainly on his years of training and preparation for becoming batman. you are almost teased throughout the first half of the movie  waiting to see the excellent christian bale in the costume  as it keeps holding back to keep you in anticipation. when batman does finally turn up on screen  it is well worth the wait. in my opinion  bale was born for this role and for the first time when watching a batman film  i enjoyed the scenes of wayne being wayne as much as wayne being batman.one of the strongest features of the film  is the way that it manges to suck you in believe that a 'batman' could be a reality one day. the technology is current  with no use of silly ott weapons and gadgets  again making the film work by today's standards. plus  we are not allowed to forget that batman is still just a man under the costume and there are times when he gets a bit of a kicking and shows that he can be vulnerable too  something we sometimes forget when watching a superhero flick. gone too  are the silly villains!!! jack nicholson was the perfect joker but from there it went downhill. thankfully  in this movie the bad guys are actually fairly 'normal' and manage to be menacing at the same time.which finally brings me to the cast. i always had high expectations for this film when the cast was announced. let's face it  what a line up! christian bale  michael caine  morgan freeman  gary oldman  liam neeson  katy holmes  ken watanabe and tom wilkinson are not to be sniffed at. even an old favourite of mine makes an appearance: rutger hauer! awesome. actors of this calibre would never have gotten involved in this project if they didn't have faith in christoper nolan's talents and thankfully they took the leap...for the comic book fans out there  waiting to see this movie  let me assure you that you won't be upset. imagine the darkness of the 'a death in the family' and the 'year one' story lines. i have never met a fan of batman who didn't love these books. well  this is the kind of batman you can expect from bale: dark  brooding and tortured by his past  yet the hero we have come to love. for those of you who are not comic fans  then just look forward to seeing how batman should be. this film is a credit to bob kane's original vision and a testament to all the talented artists and writers who keep the legend of the dark knight alive in the comic books today....thank you mr. nolan and thank you mr. bale. in fact thanks to everyone who worked on this film. batman finally begins from here....
"to tell the truth  i thought the batman franchise could never be saved  and i was really let down that i may never see my favorite superhero in a good movie ever again. then i saw the preview to batman begins  i didn't really know what to think. new batman. new alfred. new story. new style. i wasn't sure why i wanted it 'the old way'  but maybe i wanted to the actors in the batman films i grew up with  to revive themselves and make a good batman movie. i wanted robin and sadly  batgirl  alongside batman saving the world from another familiar villain.i heard batman begins  and i thought great  this was called ""batman"" in 1989  selfishly i said  ""i want something new!"".but  of course being a big batman fan  i went opening night to begings. 2 and half hours later  like the rest of the audience was completely blown away. it was the only movie i had ever been to (and yes i have been to some great ones) where the crowd claps and the end. this was not just golf claps for a popcorn clip  this was a standing ovation for 10:30 pm show in a crowded theater in austin  texas.i never would have thought this would have worked  even with nolan directing. but i was wrong  so wrong. after seeing the x-mens and spidermans  i clearly thought marvel had the upperhand and dc was just simply trying to keep up  again  so wrong.nolan gave us a dark  gritty  and pleasantly realistic  view of batman. bale gives a tremendous performance as both batman and bruce wayne. michael caine was a fabulous alfred  and morgan freeman almost stole the show as luscious fox.even though x-men and spiderman(all of them) are wonderful superhero movies  batman begins  is just a good  no  great movie. and i think that is what blew people away  that it wasn't just some superhero  special effect  hero gets girl  good guy wins movie  it was a truly dark and well crafted movie  and it maybe stupid to say  but it didn't even feel like you were watching a superhero movie.i don't even think burton  and his animated style(which works)  could have revived this troubled series  that schumaker wrecked  because like fantastic four and daredevil  tried over do it and give us the latter part of things.so  here is to you chris nolan. you saved a franchise. you made an unforgettable movie  that will be remembered as the best superhero movie of all time  but just an all around great and unforgettable movie classic."
"i have been fascinated not only by the movie (i have watched this now 10 times) but the divergence of opinion - with some germans saying it was terrible. this i don't understand. in the west from the time of charlie chaplin hitler was portrayed as a raving lunatic - but to me that does not explain his rise to power. a lunatic could not nearly conquer and enslave half the world. in his early rise to power  he was ridiculed in the west. the fact that this movie gives him some human qualities makes him all the more chilling. there is a dialog between the junge character and the braun character that perfectly summarizes hitler. they talked of the great gulf between the private man and the public man. the braun character said that she had known the man for 15 years - and yet she knew nothing of him. i believe to truly understand the movie one must also watch the movie with the director's commentary. everything about this movie - with the exception of 2 things mentioned by the director - (which having just read the spoiler agreement i will refrain from mentioning - everything was based on fact  which makes the movie all the more dramatic. and the movie characters make some minor statements - based on fact - that would be lost on the audience without outside knowledge of those historical facts.small case in point: the eva braun character is telling the traudl junge character that she ""so looked forward to coming to berlin"" with the inference (to me) that she hadn't seen hitler for awhile. then i read elsewhere that she was in obersaltzburg for 6 months away from hitler prior to coming to berlin. the director stated that he wanted this movie to be treated not only as a drama - but a documentary. he succeeded in both. i suppose this movie is controversial - a local reviewer said it tried to make hitler sympathetic by giving him some human qualities but as someone else said this makes him all the more evil. it is these human qualities that make him a believable entity - kind to many individuals  indifferent and murderous to millions. and with the end he was indifferent to the fate of his own people  who were dying for him. watching this movie made me think that the german people's initial support of hitler followed a plot from goethe - that a mephistopheles - a demon in disguise - promises the recipient all that he wants in return for his soul. this of course is a theme that has subsequently replayed countlessly in western literature since goethe's faustus. this movie is based not only on junge's book and fest's book  but interviews with some of the survivors of the bunker.i would recommend not only the movie but then watch it with commentary from the director a second time. it is all the more haunting when you realize that virtually everything was based on fact during berlin's last days.bruno ganz - as all the cast - turned in an excellent performance. watching ganz in this performance was watching hitler. you will feel as if you too are a witness in the bunker. the beginning and end statements by the real secretary traudl junge make the movie even more powerful. this movie was so moving for me that i have bought traudl junge's book  ""until the last hour"". in the us on the dvd it is said it was nominated for ""best foreign picture"" - if it didn't win  it should have."
"i teach a college course on wwii  in graduate school studied under several experts on the subject and have interviewed numerous survivors on both sides. this film comes out on top  perhaps the finest ever made on the subject of the war (though the belorussian ""come and see"" & ""schindler's list"" are darn close as well).i had the remarkable experience of watching this film last night with two veterans  one a gi who fought from omaha to czechoslovakia. . .and a german infantry officer  a veteran of four years on the eastern front. the german  who met hitler several times  within minutes was exclaiming over the historical accuracy  right down to ""hitler's"" lower class munich accent. . .something an american audience would never pick up on. my german friend  who at the end of the war was in east prussia  in the debacle of attempting to evacuate over a million civilians ahead of the russians  was profoundly shaken by the film. . .saying the horror  the hospital scenes  the utter chaos  the lynchings  the sight of 12 year old children fighting. . .all of it was real. and an interesting observation by him. . .he had no idea berlin  at the end  had been as bad as what he witnessed along the baltic coast and is still haunted by. it truly was ""gotterdammerung"" for an entire nation and this film brings it frightfully close to you. if you are a parent of small children  the terrifying ending for the goebbel's children is an absolutely searing nightmare.i think the most important point of the film was the portrayal of hitler. . .not as the stereotyped raving madman  usually overplayed like a bad performance of king richard  but far more subtle. i've talked with many who knew hitler  including a childhood playmate of helga  goebbel's oldest child  and all will tell you that hitler could be absolutely charming  focused on you  even courtly when with women. the terror is  that even as the actor shows us that ""human"" side  in his soft voice he is dictating orders  observations  and comments of absolute evil. the true form of evil rarely looks evil on the surface  it seduces us with a fair face as it leads  sometimes an entire nation  into damnation. this film captured that evil.my german friend's comment at the end of the movie. . .""i still can not believe we fought for that monster for six years."" a history professor at montreat college"
in this movie  form is more important that function. we go from one pointless subplot to the other just so that we can see these wonderful and enchanting images of worlds we have never seen. the movie never comes together because the creators (director  etc) are too busy making sure they create beautiful images and scenarios. i don't see it as a poetic anti war movie. the book may do that  but this movie is not about anything. in the uk version it is not clear why howl gives his heart to calcifer. it is not clear why howl  knowing all his problems would be solved by putting his heart back in  doesn't do it --hey  the heart was always there! it is not clear why the witch of the waste wanted howl's heart. and it is not clear why the sophie's mother all of the sudden appears in the movie in the place where she used to live. what happened to the hat shop that it was empty for them to move back in. pointless. i hate it when artists think form is more important than communicating with audiences.
"probably many people find the story confusing. i felt the same way when i saw it in the theater for the first time! the story seemed arbitrary and i couldn't connect the pieces together (much like i saw ""ashes of time"" for the first time). but when i watch it again on the dvd  i realize the movie is probably about one thing: personal freedom.howl is a free person. he doesn't has a heart and even his home (which is usually characterized as a stable point in one's life) can move :-) he is disguised as different wizards in different counties  and when sophie asks him how many identities he has  he said ""enough to guarantee my freedom"". when sophie confronts suliman  she comments howl as ""selfish and cowardly and unpredictable  but he's straight as an arrow. he only wants to be free."" but in miyazaki's world  nothing is black and white. according to suliman  howl's power is too great for a person without heart  and he will eventually becomes a monster (some political figures come to my mind).sophie  on the other hand  is bounded by responsibilities. she is young  but her heart is old. she refuses the invitation from her friends and keep working at the hat shop. when her sister asks her ""are you going to spend your life in that shop?"" she replies ""it meant so much to papa. besides  i'm the eldest."". even her sister asks her to ""look out for yourself"". when sophie is turned to an old lady  it actually set her free because the good thing of being old is that one has ""so little to lose"" she becomes more adventurous and takes control of her life. she is very assertive as being the cleaning lady in howl's castle and even tames calcifer to cook her food. for howl  his turning point comes when he refuses to move his castle anymore (i'll leave it to the reader as why he does that) by the end of movie  he regains his heart. he feels terrible because it is like ""trapped under a stone"". and sophie says  ""yes  a heart is a heavy burden"".there are other wonderful things in the movie. for example  this is probably one of the few movies that tell me what it is really like to be old. but i do want to highlight the thread about personal freedom as it will help you to tie up the pieces of the story.since there are 1000 words limit in the comment system  i'll write more in by blog: http://web.mac.com/kenlaw/iweb/site/blog/blog.html"
"... and in *no way* as clean  logical  and understandable as in pictured in that pathetic sum of tired hollywood cliches.i'm 27  and i've spent 16 years of my life struggling through delusional phobia and paranoid hallucinations. like the main character in the film  i was successful mainly because of logic : because i kept thinking over and over to keep delusion away from reality  and to know what was really going on and what wasn't. in the end  i was really successful because of medication  by the way  but i certainly escaped madness because i knew before i took medication the difference between what was real and what wasn't.so  i feel entitled to tell you that this movie is a total fraud. not only does it cheat with the main character's story (who wasn't faithful to his wife  who was bisexual - something really important here)  but mostly  it shows a comforting  tamed view of schizophrenia - which is entirely missing the point.schizophrenia is a mind structure  not a disease. a schizophrenic *isn't* a ""normal man with a disease""  it's someone who from early on views and feels things differently from most people : for him  things like time  space  and people's personalities aren't solid things. he feels it can be bent  it can change  it can mutate  and maybe even disappear. to cope with this  a schizophrenic has a rich  very imaginative inner world which ""normal"" people don't expect - but he's trapped in it because he can't relate with most people  and his world gets poorer and poorer until he finishes in a blank  delusive dead end.this is very different to what's depicted in this ridiculous ""cure""  tear-jerking movie. it should be violently frightening. people other than the main character should appear strange  weird and absurd  like in lynch's ""eraserhead""  for example. there should be *really* impressive  weird  gross hallucinations  because that's what schizophrenia is all about. it's not about *details*.i mean  watch ""naked lunch""  ""lost highway""  read p.k. dick's ""martian time-split"" or ""ubik""  do watch ""the cell""  ""perfect blue""  ""dark city""  or play ""american mcgee's alice"" on pc  and you may have a vague idea of what it's like. don't watch the ""feel good"" movie of the month  with banal situations  cleaned characters and visuals  and stupid plot tricks. ""the cell"" is the most accurate movie about a schizophrenic's mind  his visions and his inner consistency - it's violent  weird  confusing  and very  very scary.once again  schizophrenia isn't about details  it's not a neat  tame trick played to you. it jumps in your face and won't let you go : walls fall apart  people turn into strange hostile creatures  you feel like you go backward in time  you're not sure you're who you think you are  everything feels... strange  unnatural. believe me  this is much much more than what's depicted in this soap-like melodrama"
"a beautiful mind (2001) rating: 10/10a beautiful mind's greatest achievement  in my humble opinion  is the way it makes schizophrenia accessible to ""sane"" people. the general public knows schizophrenics tend to talk to themselves  repeat certain actions and do things generally at odds with the norm. but why? it's nearly impossible for a ""sane"" individual to understand why this happens...and more importantly  what that feels like. without this essential empathy  many people become frustrated with the mentally ill  asking why patients can't pull themselves together and just bear up. we express this same impatience with the criminally insane who act upon delusions with disastrous results. it is incomprehensible.a beautiful mind does all it can to change that  and it succeeds. unless you are familiar with john nash's story  you probably won't guess he's schizophrenic until part-way into the movie. he's eccentric  abrupt  and highly intelligent  but doesn't seem crazy. his delusions are as real as reality to nash  and likewise  they are real to the audience  who cannot tell the difference between truth and delusion.incidentally  i came across a review from a ""professional critic"" who blasted a beautiful mind for including ""all that spying stuff that had nothing to do with nash's work that was thrown in for hollywood thrill."" i feel bad for that chap  since he missed the entire point of the film. but that just proves ron howard's genius in creating a picture of insanity indistinguishable from reality.there are some truly shocking moments in a beautiful mind. when alicia finds her husband's secret cache of newspaper clippings behind their house  i was eerily reminded of jack nicholson's wife in the shining discovering his endless  typewritten pages of the same phrase. the scene that follows  culminating with nash's realization that his delusions are indeed a false reality is brilliant. in a moment  remembering marcee  nash has a flash of insight  and he finally accepts his illness -- ironically  through his intellect. when nash imagines that someone is going to harm alicia  he lunges at her -- and only through his eyes do we see how a seemingly senseless act of violence is a gesture of love  filtered through the smog of delusion.now my take on the acting: superb in every sense of the word. russell crowe is incredible. i can't stress that enough. there's never any question about the authenticity of his character. crowe doesn't rely on his elaborate makeup to age nash -- his walk  words  and voice do that elegantly in the movie's end. crowe will get at least another oscar nomination out of this one. and  he better win. jennifer connelly is amazing as well. and when crowe and connelly are put together  extraordinary chemistry erupts  they just gel together  they really belong with one another. some people have had problems with the romance part of the movie  saying that the way john and alicia even started seeing each other wasn't very realistic and why alicia would stay with john after he becomes distant. but  i think that maybe it started out as just a crush  you know  and the math question she showed him was just her excuse for going to his office and she already knew she was going to ask him out before hand. maybe she's just attracted to the kind of person nash is? who knows? a lot of people are attracted to the ""weirdest"" things sometimes. the crush took over the fact that he sort of insulted her work and she still asked him anyway. when you're around someone you like so much you can't help but be fooled by them. i can't really explain it  but i can understand why she still asked him to dinner. and i guess if you love someone as much as alicia loved john  then you would stick with them through anything. even how distant he became  she still stuck with him.moving on  i think ed harris is  as always  great. harris continues to prove that  simply because he's flawless. with delusions like these  no wonder nash was torn between treatment and ""spying.""simply put  a beautiful mind is a film which extends far beyond the 2 hours and 15 minutes that you will spend viewing it in the theater. the characters continued to haunt me after the movie (and still do)  thanks to the oscar-inducing performances by russell crowe  jennifer connelly and all of the supporting players. they are not merely acting  yet are transformed into the characters  leaving no trace of a line between their part and reality.of course a film is only as good as a screenplay would allow  and the story contained within is written in a way that compliments everything that is truly great about a beautiful mind. ron howard contributes truly inspiring work to this film  and i hope that the critics remember him when awards are being given out.all i can tell you now is that if you're looking for an emotionally-charged movie that will make you cry  but still filters in some very funny moments as to lighten things up every now and then  with near perfect acting  cinematography  directing  editing and a screenplay which will cause the story of john nash to inspire you  then consider a beautiful mind.i hope a lot of people see this film. not just because russell crowe is a hunk or because it's a ron howard piece  but because you will learn something important. you will learn why compassion is an absolute must when dealing with the mentally ill. you won't glare at the next person you see muttering to themselves. and when someone you love is dealing with a disorder  be it schizophrenia or depression  you won't ask them to ""pull themselves together."" you will understand why they need your love -- because they are just as confused as you are.in closing  if russell crowe isn't awarded the best actor oscar this year  then my faith in movies and its rewards system will be seriously tarnished."
this is one seriously funny movie. i've probably seen it close to 10 times and it hasn't gotten old yet. guy ritchie brings us a hilarious look into the london criminal underground in one of his earliest features. the story revolves around four friends who become indebted to the local crime lord after a card game goes horribly wrong. the humor in this movie is sharp and fast-paced. at times  it becomes a little hard to keep up with the thick british accents and the cockney rhyming slang but overall  it doesn't detract from the movie. the movie keeps you guessing as to the outcome when the story becomes complex with multiple lies and double-crosses but the ending satisfies.this film marks the debuts of two of england's coolest new actors: jason statham (who went on to do 'transporter'  among other movies) and vinnie jones (now a familiar cinema tough guy). jones is especially good as big chris  debt collector/family man. the majority of the cast aren't common faces in america (aside from sting) but they all have the charisma to keep the audience interested. another plus is the film's soundtrack  ranging from reggae to 70's soul. it adds to the movie's already laid-back feel.everyone i've seen the movie with enjoys it (once they get past the thick accents  anyway) so i can say with confidence this is a fun movie. i recommend it to anyone looking for a good comedy and i feel this movie's humor hits more often than it misses. i'd recommend giving this movie a chance at least once and i don't think you'd be disappointed.
the first time i saw this movie i had difficulty in understanding a lot of the dialogue not just because of the weird accent  but because the actors spoke so damn fast.  but despite this i became literally addicted to it. to begin with my wife got pretty annoyed because any other movie we rented would be ejected after about 20 minutes of viewing and in would go ls&2sb. now she is hooked as well.i have lost count of the number of times i have seen ls&2sb and still cannot put my finger on why i find this movie so good to watch.  i suppose the most obvious feature of this movie is that it is beautifully balanced between being serious and humorous at the same time.  the characters are two-dimensional.  the villains are menacing  and yet they are made to look like idiots  and the good guys think they are so smart yet keep getting the rug pulled from under them.  they are all projected as 'cool' yet the situation is always out of their control.  maybe it could be called a satire on true life.the style of this movie is unique  full stop.  i cannot think of any movie that can be compared to ls&2sb.  quite a few people say that the style is a mix of 'pulp fiction'  'goodfellas'  'trainspotting' and 'reservoir dogs'  but i think that you would make that kind of description only if you are really desperate to match ls&2sb to something.the best description i can think of is 'mtv does a crime comedy'  and i honestly don't think there is anything wrong with that.  like music videos  it is all non-stop movement and sound.  something is always happening but unlike music videos  not without reason.the humor is incredibly sharp yet 'as a matter of fact'.  no one is really trying to be extraordinarily funny  but again it is the balance between being menacingly serious and funny that the humor really flies at you. i think that it is for this reason that a few people are really disappointed with ls&2sb.  if you are expecting a 'belly laugh leslie nielson  jim carrey  steve martin  typecasted' type all out comedy  or a serious 'al pacino  andy garcia  deniro typecasted crime thriller  you will find this movie a big let down.my favorite characters are rory breaker (vas blackwood) and big chris (vinnie jones) mainly because their two dimensional over-the-top characters are the most obvious.  big chris takes his son with him debt collecting  and while he beats up someone who owes chastises him for swearing in front of his son and rory breaker is the most idiotic drug-lord you could come up with.i haven't even mentioned the excellent and unique camerawork  speaker blowing soundtrack  beautifully threaded plot  perfect ending and the grittiest visuals i've seen.  you wont see any reflective glass laden sky scrapers here  or 'over head city shots'  or incredible special effects. this movie has actors i have never heard of  dialogues that you have to rewind and replay to understand  buildings that look as though they have been condemned for demolition  cars that wouldn't even be seen in our scrap yards  has probably been made with a budget that most movies in hollywood use for make-up alone  has no love scenes  or romance or complex relationships  no oscar-worthy performances  and yet is perfect entertainment.where our movies normally rely on budgets  this movie works on human talent alone.if any movie deserves a 10 out of 10  then this is it.'and there's one more thing...............it's been emotional'
hands-down my favourite american film of the nineties. curtis hanson shocked the world by proving to be not only a great director but an auteur with this unbeatable adaptation of james ellroy's terrifying novel about corruption and crime among members of the lapd in the 1950s. the hard-boiled detective story angle is brought to life so beautifully  mostly because jeannine claudia oppewall's production design recreates the dark underside of the 50s to such perfection that not even a coke bottle label is missed. add to that dante spinotti's stunning lighting that rides the fine line between artistic and believable comfortably (as all period camerawork should)  ruth myers' costume designing and a script by hanson and the postman scribe brian helgeland (i know  i don't get it either) that pares down ellroy's mammoth plot about a multiple murder in a local diner involving a policeman with suspicious ties without sacrificing the density of the story or the spiderweb of events involved with it  and you have the best movie of 1997  not to mention the most fascinating detective film ever made since orson welles' touch of evil. the cast is all brilliant  most notably kim basinger as a wordly prostitute who has not only a heart of gold but a mind of steel--basinger is so strong in her character's every nuance you'll find yourself forgetting she's even acting--and kevin spacey as a dean martin-esque detective who not only solves an important part of the puzzle  he even discovers he possesses a soul beneath his flashy suits. i just can't get enough of this film.
l.a. confidential is  without a doubt  the best film of the 1990s  and quite possibly one of the best films ever made.as with any great film  it all starts with the writing.  the story is riveting  the dialogue is smart and quite funny  and the characters are written in three dimensions.the acting is phenomenal.  perhaps a bigger tragedy than l.a. confidential's loss to titanic in the best picture race is that none of the three lead actors even garnered nominations.  russell crowe  guy pearce  and kevin spacey are absolutely phenomenal; it is their characters that drive this fascinating story about police corruption in 1950s los angeles.  we get to know these people  to understand who they are and why they do what they do  and to root for them to overcome their imperfections.the directing is fantastic.  curtis hanson doesn't shove anything in the audience's face; instead  he allows the audience to discover the film's nuances on their own.  (that makes this an excellent film for repeat viewings  you truly catch something new every time).  1950s los angeles is reproduced beautifully.  the editing is quick and seamless  the music is perfect for the film (hanson should teach other directors how to do a montage effectively)  and the cinematography is great.i can't find a negative thing to say about this film.  it's truly a masterpiece.
"after 35 years in prison  a mountain bandit goes to istanbul to find the man who betrayed him and stole his lady. nothing much new here  dredging up a lot of the usual gangster/revenge/fish out of water motifs  but it does a decent job of pulling you in and manages a certain freshness despite the familiarity of the material. some of the larger dramatic scenes are painfully clichéd  but it's pieced together nicely and has some pretty good character moments. i get the feeling turgul is a more talented director than a writer. sener sem (who i just realized was also in that lousy ""rascals"" movie i recently watched) is a likable fellow  and his rapport with ugur yucel works well. overall it's a somewhat mediocre film  but quite watchable with flashes of potential."
the 'rebirth' of turkish cinema is rejoiced with perhaps one of the finest movies to ever appear in turkey.  it appears the sudden pause of the turkish cinema due to the lacking quality against the western movie market has resumed  transforming yesilcam and its unique and familiar style into something that is more recognizable by the 'new generation'.  movies like kahbe bizans  abuzer kadayif  eskiya  and tv series like ikinci bahar and yilan hikayesi are some of the finest examples of this.  yet these are far more than simple replications of the western styles  these contain an element of the turkish culture and people that we are so used to seeing. this is the essence of the brilliance beneath eskiya.  the way it accurately reflects our troubles and the way we deal with them.beginning with the first scene  we become aware of the how incredibly well written the script is and the realism and truthfulness beneath the characters.  this realism in fact is drawn to such a scale that at no poin t in the movie  do we feel anger at any character  or identify one as evil; merely the victims of the horrible system in which we live in  and the incidents we read in the papers everyday.  while national problems such as migration  organized crime  and poverty are all central themes to the movie  so are human emotions like betrayal and revenge.  even the bizarre ending filled with numerous deaths appears very natural.the acting also is quite remarkable.  sener sen  being a great actor  portrays baran superbly  while ugur yucel with his unquestionable talent does his part and every other role is cast with incredible thought and consideration.  the climax i thought shows this  the best  sener sens monologue on the rooftop scene had tears coming out of my eyes.overall  it would be very unjust to say that this is the greatest turkish movie to be ever filmed because  being a kid of the new generation  i would simply be completely blocking out 50+ years of yesilcam.  however with it's great script  the warmth we feel towards the characters  and the amazing performances by the actors   this is one of the best and it most certainly is a symbol of the rebirth of turkish cinema.  if you are turkish and haven't seen or heard about this movie  you probably slept through the last 5 years go see it now! and if you're not turkish  you should still see it.  i recommend it to anyone.
i think i watched this once a very long time ago when i was young  but i didn't remember much. now that the irishman is coming up with de niro and paciono again  it made me look into this movie and rewatch at  now as an adult  very long after the first time  and it was almost like i was watching it for the first time.this movie is so damn good. i can't remember the last time i saw a crime thriller this good  so i guess sthey just don't make them like this anymore  sadly...the writing  the characters  the directing  the acting  the action  the drama  the suspense  the music...it's all so good  i have to say this is probably one of the best movies in the genre that i've seen. a masterpiece. the 3 hours do not overstay their welcome. this one will most likely grip you. i grew attached to the villain  even though i knew i shouldn't. do yourself a favour and watch this. for myself i think i'm gonna go ahead and buy it  actually. movies rarely ever satisfy me like this anymore...
sound like a bold statement? devotees of classic cops and robbers flicks of old will no doubt take exception  but i believe that michael mann achieved some measure of perfection with heat. to break this three-hour gem of a film down to its core  this is a film about men - strong men - and the supporting role that he women of the film have on them for better or worse. take pacino as good cop vincent hanna: one of the most intense characterizations of the tragic hero that i have ever witnessed  as he laments the demise of his third marriage to a pill-junkie wife. a fact which he discusses with his archnemesis (de niro) in what history will regard as one of the most frenetic scenes in the history of film. the dialogue in this scene (at the very end of the first tape  if you own the vhs version) sets up the last half of the film beautifully  as our two rivals come to the joint realization that they have no hand in choosing the paths that will lead them to their ultimate confrontation: their very natures so define their respective actions that any attempt to do otherwise would simply be a waste of time. while i have heard others (who i am ashamed at times to call close friends) say that heat drags in places  i will concede that there are moments in the film that require more than the cursory attention that they give to the movie they happen to be watching at any given time (i'm sorry not every director is jerry bruckheimer)  there are poignant developments of character in heat that many would casually disregard. i am thinking of the interaction between the ex-con who finds conditional employment in a diner with an opportunistic scum of a boss  and whose girlfriend is so proud of him for swallowing his pride and not simply giving the sonofabitch a good pummeling. but there is a catharsis that i felt for that same ex-con when de niro's character presents him with the opportunity to take just one more score  for old time's sake. who doesn't feel for this guy - this minor character in a film with big-time heavyweights who gets to shine for a few brief moments. that's what heat is really: a series of brief moments  some touching  others traumatic  and still others incredibly horrifying in the feelings that they inspire in the romantic who  like me sees not black or white portrayals of protagonist and villain  but a montage of grays that combine to create a vivid spectrum of film characterization that could not be found in hundreds of films combined. one of my five favorite films of all time  heat is a cinematic banquet of intense imagery and pulse-pounding action. come hungry.
"this movie is entertaining  for sure  but just one attentive glance at the editing and you know scorcese's struggling to make it work.  the voice-overs simply function to move the plot in places where the filmed action can't take it.  a film relying on voice-over for exposition is usually missing some pieces.  plus as a movie about how relationships can dissolve there really isn't much to work from.  the rothstein/ginger connection is totally breezed over and you get no real sense of their relationship  other than ""he's controlling"" and ""she's nuts.""  plus joe pesci is simply reprising his role from goodfellas.  in fact it seems the entire movie is just a goodfellas retread  but without the great pacing and script that kept that classic together.  just because martin scorcese directed it  doesn't mean it's good!"
"a complex  multilayered  beautifully directed film  martin scorsese's casino is a masterpiece of destruction and betrayal. few films take so many chances and succeed so wonderfully. it takes some of the basic formulas that were found in goodfellas and applies them to another type of story - while goodfellas' view was ground-level  telling the story of the ""blue collar"" gangsters of nyc  this film tells the story of the guys who controlled those guys. and it's fascinating to watch these people run las vegas  control the flow of money  and then fall from the heights of power due to lust  hubris  and greed. an amazing film that will hopefully get the recognition it deserves in the years to come."
"i'm a huge fan of ""early"" clint eastwood (you can see by some of my other reviews) and have seen unforgiven (1992) several times  but i just can't completely get into this film and don't think it's a masterpiece  as with several of his other films that he has starred in and/or directed (a fistful of dollars  dirty harry  high plains drifter  and the criminally underrated elegiac a perfect world). also  there are several other ""lesser"" other eastwood works that i'd pop into the dvd player before this one  ones that i find to be provocative  immensely entertaining  or re-watchable or all of the above (hang em high  the gauntlet  the enforcer  sudden impact  tightrope).with unforgiven  i think a recurring word i find when i watch it is ""monotony"". at the end of the day  i think everything is too one-dimensional. on repeated viewings  i find nothing really deep or provocative about this film. i don't pick up on anything. it's a well-made  professional film with decent-to-good acting  but that's about it. the only 2 characters that i find to be interesting are the ones played by gene hackman (little bill daggett) and richard harris (english bob). everyone else just is kind of ""there"". not to mention that virtually all the characters seem like the same person! there is no uniqueness about any of them.save for daggett and little bill  they all have the same mannerisms  mood  and tone. i've seen many so-called ""lesser"" films with better developed  written  and performed characters that allowed me to latch onto the film the more and more i watched it. with unforgiven  these characters (and there are tons of them) fall way too flat. examples: the scene where munny  the kid (played by jamie woolvett)  and the (totally unnecessary!) morgan freeman character track down the first of the 2 men they are to kill is totally devoid of real emotion and resonance. i feel nothing when watching this scene. the acting by all involved is strangely similar (freeman ironically being the weakest link in this scene). eastwood did freeman no favors by casting him in this film. seems like stunt  friendship casting as far as i'm concerned.eastwood (as former vicious killer  but now reformed family man william munny) strangely evokes very little as the lead. it is hard to buy that this man was once a vicious killer simply because eastwood gives himself the same singular tone as most of the rest of the cast. then all of a sudden at the end he is a badass again. i think the intent was right  but the execution (pardon the pun!) is rather unbelievable. this ending scene is in it's own right pretty spectacular as it demystifies the mythology of gunslinging that so many films before (ironiclly including many early eastwood westerns) had glamourized and i find it (and the daggett-english bob scenes) to be the only good ones.at the end of the day  a great film ought to draw you in  not push you away. unforgiven  sadly  does the latter."
there may never be another real western. clint appears to be done with the genre and there really isn't anyone else i can think of that can do it properly. sergio leone is gone. william wellman is gone. sam peckinpah is gone. john huston is gone. john ford is gone. howard hawks is gone.kevin costner tries hard but he just doesn't get it. dances with wolves wasn't really a western. it wasn't even an anti-western. it was more like a political indictment of the actions of the americans of the time. for all that i did enjoy it.most of the others since unforgiven are movies where somebody decides to put the characters on a horse  but the story is just generic pap. nobody has the balls to make something with a meaning.i will grant that deadwood is a truly excellent series but it isn't a movie.that's why i believe that unforgiven is a fitting end to the western genre. i won't get all rhapsodic and spout a bunch of crap about how clint made this movie as a symbol of the end of the western. cuz that's a load of crap. the script had been around since the early 70s when things were still going strong. what it is  is a movie that shows us that there is no black and white in any time. there are only shades of grey.it is also just as dirty and violent as things actually were for most people in that era. life was comparatively cheap and most people didn't have much hope of justice. the middle class was very small and the upper class was tiny. the vast majority belonged to the under-classes.good guys didn't wear white hats and not every sheriff was a good guy. some were violent and corrupt braggarts and bullies. little bill mocks english bob's self-promotion  but at the same time he knocks bob down he builds himself up. he doesn't bother with courts or judges and he is his own executioner. he isn't motivated by any innate sense of justice when he deals with any criminal elements. it's more that he takes it as an insult to his own power.william munny is a killer  plain and simple. he has human feelings but basically he is unrepentant. he changed for his wife  but like many changes it wasn't permanent. he won't sleep with a whore but when he needs money he is willing to kill for it. at the same time he treats the whore with kindness and is loyal to his friend. and somehow he managed to get a good woman to love him. a classic anti-hero.rather than being about the end of the western genre i believe that it is actually an ode to what came before it. sergio leone would have been proud.
the second sequel to raiders of the lost ark is an awesome  beautifully crafted film  and arguably the best of the indiana jones trilogy. the film is funnier  classier and far more laid back than the other two woody story lines  mostly because of the introduction of the excellent sean connery as indy's eccentric father. spielberg and lucas get back on track after their off the rails first sequel in which to many peoples' horror had none of the nazis or characters that made raiders so unique  however  what spielberg does to make this film a classic is the use of historical data with the swashbuckling storyline of adventure and action. not to mention that this may well be the greatest feel good film ever made...
"indiana jones and the last crusade (1989) is an action classic adventure better film than temple of doom   is still the best follow up in the trilogy and clever. it is also the greatest sequel of all time. it is one of my personal favorite adventure movies of all time. i love this movie to death. i loved it as a child and i still love it. after the dark middle chapter it was time for indy to return to form and more lighthearted fair. indiana jones and the last crusade was the answer. not to mention that bringing in bond aka sean connery as indy's dad was perfect casting. connery adds his own whit & charm along with indy's usual counterparts who where missed in the temple of doom. last crusade also bookends the trilogy well since the artifact he is after is related to god. while ""indiana jones and the last crusade"" isn't by any means what i would consider a stellar film  it was still an enjoyable and memorable theatrical experience  and in my opinion  easily ranks as the best sequel in the series. for all its faults and shortcomings (perhaps most of all  river phoenix' laughably terrible haircut as the young indy)  the film succeeds in hitting the key notes at the proper moments  thus drumming up enough of the right combination of story and thematic elements  action and humor to make it worthwhile. nevertheless  the bottom line is that it still pales in comparison to the level of across-the-board excellence that was achieved in the original 1981 movie. still though  fans of this one will definitely want to pick up this excellent release  of which  throughout the entire presentation  i only came across a handful of things i thought could possibly be improved upon technically.this is probably the best installment of the indiana jones series. raiders is a spectacular introduction to dr. jones and his style  temple of doom is an awesome action  adventure flick! last crusade rights the ship again with a go-for-broke production. everything about it is huge- jones is saving the planet from the nazis for the second time. the budget was in place and off went spielberg to make an epic  successfully. the film is bookended by two of the best things to appear in any of spielberg's output: a young indiana ""beginning"" his archaeological career  losing his treasure- just like the opening of raiders- and being told by the man in his trademark hat ""you lost today kid  but that doesn't mean you have to like it."" and at the end  riding off into the sunset  literally. such a conclusion could be seen as contrived but it works so well here. indiana jones and the last crusade has lots of hand-to-hand combat  action-filled chases  and gun fights. main characters are in near-constant peril  and one is shot point blank and almost bleeds to death. minor characters are killed in somewhat gruesome ways  including beheading; a bad guy meets his end in a fairly disturbing scene. there's a bit of kissing/banter  and it's implied that two men have slept with the same woman. language is mild  and there's ultimately a strong message about the importance of the father-son relationship.indiana jones and the last crusade is a 1989 american adventure film directed by steven spielberg  from a story co-written by executive producer george lucas. it is the third installment in the indiana jones franchise. a cult film  still one of my favorite films in the series and the last good indiana jones movie we didn't need another sequel after third release. there's nothing more exciting than trying to keep up with the joneses in indiana jones and the last crusade. indy's nazi enemies are back and have kidnapped his father  professor henry jones sr. (sean connery)  in their effort to locate the sacred holy grail. following a trail from america to venice to the deserts of the middle east  it's up to indy (harrison ford) to save his father  save the grail and save the day in this non-stop  action-packed adventure the whole family will treasure.the chemistry between sean connery and harrison ford makes this movie a stand out from the rest of the series. the story of their father and son relationship wrapped in the search for the holy grail is what makes this spectacular indy movie  a more meaningful adventure. 10/10 bad ass seal of approval"
"it pains me to give it an average rating  but the fact that i wanted more of it proves that i was enjoying what we got before it came to an abrupt end. i was certain that i had accidentally hit the chapter skip button my remote  but nope  i did indeed watch the whole movie.it's summer 1955 and very cute and curious 4-year-old mei and her sister satsuki move out into the country with their dad while their mother is in hospital. the creaky  dusty old house that they move into appears to be hot spot for forest spirits and magical creatures. as with all hayao miyazaki movies there is a heavy theme of nature being beautiful and the earth being precious but where is the story?mei soon meets ""totoro"" a giant cat/rabbit thing  who does...pretty much nothing. totoro is barely in the movie. i've seen pictures of him for years  i even carry around a totoro satchel at work. i assumed that the movie would be filled with their wondrous discoveries  summertime adventures  and  y'know  some kind of plot! but nope. he's barely in it. seriously  where is the rest of this film? i assume all those picture i saw were merely fan art and not stills from the actual film.at one point mei runs off to find her mother but gets lost on her way to the hospital. satsuki enlists totoro to help her and he summons the catbus to locate mei and take them both to the hospital and the film ends there. that's it! my jaw was on the floor when the credits began to roll  and not in a good way.the animation is simply beautiful and is the perfect antidote to the ostentatious horror of modern cgi animated movies  the kids are cute  and totoro (all 2 minutes he has on screen) is one of the most huggable characters ever created  but i am sorry i have to rate this on the lower rung of miyazaki movies. there should have been more to this."
i first watched this film in japanese with a 12 year old translating for me and i still thought it was incredible. there are so many wonderful touches  like a tin can in the stream while the kids are fascinated by a fish  or the flying scenes (i'm convinced that ang lee thought of miyazaki when he made the hulk  just in terms of the jumping scenes) that show a curious mind at work throughout the picture. i also love the sense of magic and innocence (and the lack of violence) which pervades the movie. it is a real antidote from the disney formula which always involves a villain being trashed at the end. this is a film about the wonder of being a child and experiencing something incredible which adults can't see but recognize nonetheless. it works for any age as well. enjoy.
"every christmas  there are 2 movies that i have to watch: ""national lampoon's christmas vacation"" and ""die hard"".every guy that i talk to about this agrees that ""die hard"" is a classic christmas movie. when i talk to women about this  i haven't met a single one that agrees. my wife certainly doesn't agree  but she watches it with me each year anyway.from the first scene where john is in argyle's limo  the snow's falling and we hear a more hip-hop themed christmas it just feels right. when john does get to his destination  it's a good-old-fashioned christmas office party... everyone is in good spirits and sharing some cheer.sure  there's lots of killing later in the movie  but that doesn't take away from the christmas feeling that i always have when i watch this movie.if you celebrate christmas and you haven't yet incorporated this movie into your christmas ritual  do so this year."
"die hard (1988) the first action film is by far one of the greatest best action movies of all time from the 80's till this day hands down. it is my number 1 personal favorite action movie of all time  i love this movie to death! i love it so damn much and i have fun watching it so much. i have to talk about this movie: it is one man army fighting against a team of terrorists with automatic weapons and plastic explosives. bruce willis performance was excellent in this movie john mcclane is his best role ever. it is my number 1 personal favorite action movie of all time  i love this movie to death! it's stay in my heart forever. to me it felt this film realistic and it makes you think that you are alone trapped in a building against bunch of terrorists what will you do? this film has heart and soul. a lot of movies have try to do that premise since  but no movie has nail it like ""die hard."" this is a modern day action film of the action genre. i watch this film as a teenager i even watch it with my mom it was ultimate thrill ride. i love everyone in here all the characters and the lead character. i love that mcclane is alone he has no help  all telephones doesn't work he is barefoot with his gun and the only help has is from sgt. al powell down there who didn't even see him at all but were both talking on a radio from cop to cop. i love that bond between those two lead heroes. i always love when mcclane talks to himself whenever he was about to do something crazy. it is going to be 30 years anniversary this summer 20th july. i love this film to death i am hugh fan of die hard films i love this film so damn much. i would really love to see this movie in a widescreen in a movie theater. it was directed by brilliant john mctiernan it is is based on a novel roderick thorp nothing lasts forever. this is a masterpiece action film that started all action genre one man army types battling terrorists while trapped in a confined space. it was arguably the first one in the action genre. this movie has everything . it has intense action  drama  thriller  twists  great dialogue  explosions  fights. exploding building  great helicopter explosion action scenes. john mcclane is one man against a whole team of terrorists. a cracking action thriller from beginning to end  die hard explodes with heart-stopping suspense! it has great cast  great plot  great explosions  no shaky cam  doesn't deal with cgi  but real actions real practical effects. great direction from john mctiernan  great dialogues  great acting from everyone. everyone does an excellent job. bruce willis is a bad ass action star as john mcclane. it has a great bad-ass action hero who does impossible buy stopping the terrorists who were actually a real terrorists who try to steal the money in a vault 640.000.000$ in bearer bonds stored in the building's vault. my favorite action sequences and the best part of die hard: mcclane grabs the fire hose  ties it around his body jumps with the helicopter about to kill him. then gruber blows it a second after mclane jumps off the roof! it was an incredible explosion that totally takes out the helicopter. but mclane is falling down the side of the building and needs to get inside quickly this is the best scene in the movie my favorite. mcclane climbs in the elevator shaft escapes karl and his men trying to kill him. mcclane shoots on the table with his gun killing marco. (according to the director  the proximity of the gun to willis' ear during this scene caused permanent hearing loss for willis.) 
mcclane shot's hans and eddie ""happy - trails  hans..."" incredibly satisfying action in a brilliant action movie! mcclane try to save ellis when ellis try to save him self. mcclane was afraid of flying and he always carry gun because he was afraid someone would have hijack it. the fight between karl and john was excellent and well choreographed. mcclane drops c4 down the elevator shaft and destroys the entire floor where the terrorists are firing from  giving the cops a chance to retreat. i love the broken glass scene. he shoot's and kills two terrorists with his machine gun to escape hans and karl  john mcclane is forced to sprint over broken glass while barefoot the best bad-ass scene in the movie my all time favorite. three terrorists are shooting on mcclane on the roof chasing him in which he escapes in the beginning of the movie awesome. karl shoots in an elevator shaft in which mcclane is hiding a real kick-ass scene i love this film to death! i love the characters in this movie: john mcclane a real action hero to me that does something that no one can he stops a team of terrorists. hans grubar the german mastermind he was ruthless and brilliant and he would do anything to steal the money even killing people and get what he want's. alan rickman's performance was excellent i love him to death in this movie. i really miss the actor he was the best villain of the whole world. the lapd supervisor (diana james) i like that girl she was so good when mcclane call's her for help  i love it. i love sgt. al powell how he stand's up and defends mcclane against his supervisor. reginald veljohnson does a brilliant performance as a great supporting hero in this movie. i love deputy police chief dwayne t. robinson to death he is my favorite character in here. paul gleason was so good i love his performance - ""kick ass."" i love how he tried everything to safe the hostages including swat team who were badly hurt. i like richard thornburg in this movie who is annoying reporter but i still like it. bonnie bedelia as holly mcclane's wife was great.john mctiernan directed excellent this masterpiece jeb stuart and steven e. de souza wrote a script that it delivers. the helicopters in here were models in this movie delivered  to me the action scenes felt realistic. this movie has ton's of action and you never get bored with it. michael kamen made a music score and you never get bored with it. you'll see lots of heavy automatic and explosive weapons  and you'll see them used well. the film is violent  and bloody rated r with real blood squibs. 10/10 it is my favorite action film in the action genre i love this film to death it is my personal action favorite film. i miss movies like this i miss action movies like this one today i want them back. it is a shame we don't have movies like this today."
"ran is a second-rate retelling of the lear story  so the flaws in the plot are easiest to explain with reference to king lear. these are some of the important differences: the subplot is dropped; goneril and regan are turned into effete men; an injured and vengeful daughter-in-law is introduced; the lear-figure (hidetora) is a warlord rather than a king; the mad lear scene is weakened to insignificance; the sons try to kill old hidetora by having a few thousand men fire at him as he sits in a castle; and the additional character of tsurumaru  a boy who was blinded by hidetora at some point in his murderous career  is introduced.hidetora is a smaller man than lear; he has the stubbornness without the nobility. his abdication is also a lot sillier. lear errs by trusting that people will treat him decently: hidetora errs by supposing that they will forget that they hate him. this is also much more implausible. after all  there is nothing monstrous or unnatural about the daughter-in-law's attitude towards hidetora; she just wants her back  and with reason. this diminishes her  and in spite of kurosawa's attempt to make her a sex maniac  she is not as large or as interesting as goneril/regan.unlike lear  ran does not give us a sense of the insignificance of man in nature. the ""majestic"" (read pompous) scenery shots don't make us feel that man in general is helpless—these are no giants to be dwarfed by nature  just a murderer and an injured woman and several wimps.the strong stoical undertone of lear is lost for obvious reasons. samurai cannot be stoics; they are people who are trained to kill themselves whenever the going gets inglorious. it is amusing but not profound that hidetora cannot find a dagger to kill himself with when the need arises.so what's left of lear? only this: people in the world are evil. if you hurt them they'll hurt you when they can. you should be good even if you suffer (like the blind boy)  because general goodness and suffering are the only way to avoid family feuds and make the world a better place. which is all very edifying  but also very trite.it must also be noted that because of the lingering  ponderous  ""epic"" pacing of this film  it goes on for twice as long as it should. what to expect: 160 minutes of intense tedium as this misshapen hulk of a film drags itself laboriously towards its predictable close.watching ran is like running for your life for 2 hours and 40 minutes  but with none of the excitement."
akira kurosawa's 1985  ran  is based one of shakespeare's greatest works  king's lear. the film proudly stands along with his other classic such as seven samurai  yojimbo  roshomon  sanjuro and the hidden fortress. he is a master in the art of filmmaking  no one can film an epic battle scene quite like kurosawa. this is recognized as the most expensive film ever made by akira kurosawa  it was at that time  japan's most expensive film ever. being at the age of 75  he still showed us  he's one of the best in the business.this movie is about an aging lord  head of the ichimonji family  decides to retire and to pass the power to taro  the eldest of his three sons. he will however have to banish saburo  the youngest one  who dared to speak the truth to him. soon  the former lord is chased away from the castles of his sons and becomes mad when he understands that one of his sons is trying to kill him. the three brothers are fighting for control of the kingdom  as their lust for power grows every day. four armies are facing each other on the prairie. lord ichimonji's former peaceful kingdom is nothing but a distant memory.akira kurosawa redefines what an epic film is  with astonishing story telling  entirely believable characters and real life battle scenes without the use of special effects/cgi. he retells the story of king lear in his own way and no one would recognize that it was actually a adaptation beforehand. but just like shakespeare  there is humor  irony  death and not a happy ending. everyone who played a part in the production of this film  deserves some kind of recognition. the acting is pretty much excellent and certainly believable.10/10 kurosawa is a genius
"from my understanding  before this film was made  martin scorsese  arguably america's greatest filmmaker  was at the end of his rope. he was about to call it quits. his good friend  arguably america's greatest film actor  robert de niro  approached him with a book he had read. the title of the book was raging bull. after some coaxing  robert finally convinced his friend to do the film  and it resulted in a masterpiece!!!!!
""raging bull"" is the story of former boxing middleweight champion jake la motta  and his penchant for self-destruction. la motta is not in the least a nice guy. he is well  a jerk  who eventually drives any and everyone who has ever cared about him out of his life. he evolved from a lean  trim boxer to an overweight loser who owns a night club.this film currently ranks on afi's 100 greatest movies at #24  and for very good reason. it contains arguably the greatest acting performance in the history of cinema  by arguably the greatest actor in the history of cinema  directed by arguably the greatest director in the history of cinema. but together  nothing needs to be argued  they are the greatest tag team in the history of cinema. robert de niro is flawless  superb  excellent  amazing  any positive adjective is warranted by his performance. there is a reason why they call him the greatest actor. this is it. (also ""taxi driver"") naturally  scorsese's direction is flawless  and thelma schoonmaker's editing will pretty much speak for itself. the black-and-white(or tinted monochrome) was an ingenious touch  similar to william friedkin's gunshot at the very end of ""the french connection"". it is the most beautiful movie i have ever seen  if it were a woman i could only beg to drink its bathwater. joe pesci is excellent as jake's brother joey  as is cathy moriarty as jake's long suffering wife. it is sad when you realize that de niro will never act that great again  but you find solace in the fact that he once did. he is maybe my favorite actor  scorsese maybe my favorite director  and i only hope to have a millionth of the impact they've had on film. far superior to ""rocky""  even though rocky is very good and contains maybe the most inspirational theme song ever.this film was criminally robbed of 1980's best picture and best director academy awards  by ""ordinary people""  another one of those dysfunctional family drama's. the academy has since lost a huge amount of credibility  but i find solace in the fact that they honored de niro with an award for best actor  in a performance that warrants two of them and makes me want to shine his shoes.the film gets nothing less than a 10. it was voted the film of the 1980's decade. i agree wholeheartedly.scorsese and de niro forever."
"""raging bull"" isn't the average  stereotypical underdog boxing movie  because it isn't really about boxing at all. like most great movies  its focus is much deeper. it came out in 1980  earned robert de niro a best actor academy award  and was marked down as another solid triumph by director martin scorsese  whose previous 1976 outing with de niro earned them both critical acclaim (and for de niro  an oscar nomination  although he would actually earn an oscar for ""raging bull"" four years later).it dwindled in production hell for quite some time  with scorsese's drug use halting production and only the duo's strong willpower that kept the project moving ahead. it was after de niro read boxer jake lamotta's memoirs that he knew he wanted to make the film  so scorsese and de niro turned to paul schrader for a script. schrader  who had previously written ""taxi driver"" (1976)  agreed  and wrote the screenplay for them. the rest is history.""raging bull"" has often been regarded as the greatest film of the 80s. to be honest  i'm not so sure about that  since various genres offer different feelings and emotions (comparing this to a comedy might seem rather silly). but to say it is one of the most powerful films of all time would be no gross overstatement -- it is superb film-making at its finest.de niro gained 60 pounds to play lamotta  which was an all-time record at the time (later beaten by vincent d'onofrio  who gained 70 pounds for stanley kubrick's ""full metal jacket""). his physical transformation is on-par with any great screen makeover  especially the most recent  ranging from willem dafoe in ""shadow of the vampire"" to charlize theron in ""monster."" in addition  co-star joe pesci also lost weight for his role of joey  lamotta's short  eccentric brother. the greatest scene in the film is when lamotta accuses his brother of having an affair with his wife. the tension is raw  the dialogue amazing  and the overall intensity electrifying.the film is most often compared to ""rocky "" more than any other  apparently because they both concern a certain level of boxing. as much as i absolutely adore ""rocky "" ""raging bull"" is a deeper  more realistic film. but whereas ""raging bull"" is raw  ""rocky"" is inspiring  and that is one of the reasons i do not think these two very different motion pictures deserve comparison  for the simple fact that they are entirely separate from one another. the only connecting thread is the apparently central theme of boxing  which is used as a theme in ""rocky "" and a backdrop in ""raging bull."" they're entirely different motion pictures -- one uplifting  the other somewhat depressing -- and the people who try to decide which is better need to seriously re-evaluate their reasons for doing so. they both succeed splendidly well at what they are trying to do  and that's all i have to say about their so-called connection.de niro  who could justifiably be called the greatest actor of all time  is at the top of his game here. in ""taxi driver"" he displayed a top-notch performance. he wasn't just playing travis bickle -- he was travis bickle. and here he is jake lamotta  the infamous boxer known for his abusive life style and somewhat paranoid delusions during his reign as world middleweight boxing champion  1949 - 1951. throughout the film  he beats his wife (played expertly and convincingly by the 19-year-old cathy moriarty)  convinced that she is cheating on him  and that is more or less what the film is truly about. the boxing is just what he does for a living  and could be considered as a way to release some of his deeper  harbored anger.lamotta has a close relationship with joey  his brother  and their interaction is often what elevates the film above others of its genre. the dialogue is great  close to the perfection of quentin tarantino's ""pulp fiction "" rich in that rapid-fire filthy language and brutal insults. pesci  who was on the verge of quitting showbiz at the time of pre-production  was spotted by de niro in a cheap b-movie named ""the death collector"" (1975)  a.k.a. ""family business "" a truly horrid film that nevertheless showcased an early sign of things to come for pesci. de niro wanted him for the movie and his premonition was either very lucky or very wise -- this is one of the best performances of pesci's entire career.scorsese shot the film in muted black and white  portraying a certain era of depression and misery. to make the blood show up on screen during the occasional fight scenes  scorsese used hershey's syrup -- which is an interesting tidbit of trivia for any aspiring film-making planning on filming a violent movie in black and white. but how often does that happen?this is certainly one of the most intense films scorsese has directed  and one of the most important of his career. along with ""taxi driver "" it is an iconic motion picture that will stand the test of time for years and years to come. scorsese and de niro's partnership over the years has resulted in some of the most influential and utterly amazing motion pictures of all time: ""mean streets "" ""taxi driver "" ""the king of comedy "" ""goodfellas"" and ""casino"" come to mind almost instantly. but perhaps the one single title that will be remembered as their most daring effort is ""raging bull "" a motion picture so utterly exhilarating that it defies description. it is simply a masterpiece for the mind and senses  leaving you knocked out cold after its brutal one-two punch. if i had to assemble a list of required viewing  this would be up there towards the top."
"another one of the most disappointing movies i've ever seen. what i felt was worst about stalker was that it came across as pretentious  a term i do not use lightly. where normally a director would attempt to engage their audience somehow  to make their thoughts and ideas in some way accessible  tarkovsky seems to have the attitude that there is no need for this  that people should patiently watch a slow  uninvolving movie and simply figure it out for themselves. granted  i would agree that in general audiences should be patient and open minded with films and that very often  especially with ""great"" movies  the more an audience puts in  the more they get out. this was certainly not the case with stalker which i felt practically alienated its audience rather than welcoming them in.i would like to be proved wrong and i'm sure i could have payed more attention in areas (although this is arguably the fault of the film to some degree). but even if i later find stalker not to be so pretentious  it remains unnecessarily long and slow paced. plus  there isn't any clear pay off at the end. no climax.for example  the cinematography was predictable and repetitive  and even worse  drew attention to itself. in the first 10 seconds of various shots you notice that you are (very very) slowly zooming in (or out) and you immediately know that for the next few minutes  that's all you're gonna get. it wouldn't matter so prominent if the film were more eventful and interesting. i felt that its style didn't create an atmosphere so much as it reflected the lack of creativity from the filmmakers.nevertheless  i thought the acting was very good but it's hard to get into the characters if almost every shot is a wide shot and there are barely any close-ups. the music was forgettable  not necessarily bad per se but clearly lacking in power and effectiveness. some of the locations were quite memorable and imaginative but i can't help but feel as though they were barely explored or touched upon. some of the shots were nice and bring you into the movie's world quite well (for example  the abrupt colouration change) but these moments are unfortunately few and far between. also  some of the dialogue was interesting but it never seemed to go anywhere.i have to admit  it is quite likely that i just completely missed the point of stalker or that it's so different from what i have seen that i was unable to properly appreciate its merits. in that case i look forward to finally enjoying it some time in the distant future (i'm not keen to rewatch it anytime soon).nevertheless  if i've established anything from watching stalker in my personal quest to understand and appreciate film  it's the importance of the tone of a film. if a film comes across as at all pretentious  it is virtually impossible to enjoy  no matter what qualities it does have. in terms of measuring or defining pretentiousness  the best way i can think of putting it is that somehow one gets the impression not as much effort was put into the film as could have been and that instead the audience is expected to put it together for themselves; the filmmakers don't work for attention and appreciation  they simply expect it."
"andrei tarkovsky is a rarity among filmmakers in that he creates films that resemble elaborate (and always smartly written  beautifully shot and superbly acted) puzzles. the pieces are always scattered  and tarkovsky relies on his viewer to bring the final element of the puzzle along with him. solaris explores the boundaries of consciousness and the sense of grief (and it uses the titular planet as a metaphor for god). andrei roublev is a multi-layered voyage into religious belief. stalker  however  is far more spiritual and existential than both of them.a teacher and a scientist wish to go to a restricted patch of nature - the mythical conscious ""zone"" - to make their wishes come true. to enter the area and survive its numerous danger  they hire a man sensible to the zone's thoughts and actions  a stalker. what they find there turns out to be very different from what they expected  as they come to discover who they truly are.there's only so much you can say without getting drowned in details that would appear heavy-handed on paper but flow seamlessly on screen. quite often  tarkovsky reduces his characters to silence  letting their movements and eyes convey their thoughts and feelings and letting the viewer bring his own thoughts and beliefs to the film. one of stalker's many treats is that it invites you to get carried away into your own thoughts  flowing with the images as it provides new questions to ponder... in that sense  the film is very much like a philosophical poem: a very simple surface covering innumerable layers of meaning. yet the images tarkovsky provides - whether filming landscapes or wide-shots or simply peering into his actors' extraordinary faces - make this almost hypnotic.stalker is a treasure: an invitation to go on a mental ride with a poet and philosopher. a film that makes you wonder more about yourself yet without making you anxious. the few existing films like stalker are the reason why cinema is called ""art""!"
this is how to make a comedy. laughs can be found throughout  and the 4th wall falls apart throughout the film without any actors chewing the scenery. the movie from the first scene  and on is great. the acting is wonderful. everybody in the cast delivers the jokes hilariously. also the the actors never seem to overact at all. there are a few jokes that go on for to long  but it is aware of this. if only another comedy that doesn't deserve to have its name mentioned (cough disaster movie cough) was self-aware that the jokes it had were to long. it really is a shame that british people can say that they have awesome comedies like this  and we have a lot of awful comedies like (sigh) disaster movie. this film is a work of genius.4 stars out of 4
"well  this is unquestionably one of the funniest movies ever made. the first time a saw it i laughed to tears and this is the only time that counts. the first time you get the best experience. i really envy those who haven't seen it yet. from the opening scene to the sudden ending this one won't let you leave the room. especially the opening scene: ""are you trying to say that coconuts migrate"" or when john cleese trying to be tarzan  hanging on the rope said: ""can somebody give me a push."" an absolute masterpiece.
considering the low budget that the creators of the movie had at their disposal would probably make ""the holy grail"" the best movie in this genre-silly nonsense kind of stuff. it shows the great creativity and acting capabilities of the monty python crew. it comes to say that a movie can be made with a little bit of money - a great movie. 10 out of 10"
a film about la and water set in the l930's during a drought with a dark incestuous subplot and some stunning performances by faye dunaway and jack nicholson  and superb cinematography that seemed to capture the essence of la. directed by roman polanski  who makes a terrific cameo appearance as a switchblade wielding heavy  and using the considerable acting talents of john huston as a ruthless and perverted landowner. read cadillac desert to know about la's water grab but see chinatown for its brilliant allegory of water and corruption  both public and private. the direction  the screenplay  the acting  the photography  and the soundtrack combine to make a convincing and atmospheric picture. the crushing ending is just so much more icing on the cake.
"i knew chinatown was hailed as the paragon of a film noir  and that's why i finally got down to watching it. however  despite having known about the movie for quite a while  i wasn't really prepared for just how dark it could be. the movie starts slowly  with a private detective taking on what looks like a routine case. but soon he finds himself enmeshed in a web of conspiracy  murder  lies and deceit. the plot is like a perfect machine that relentlessly moves towards a final resolution that is truly epic and truly soul-wrenching.in a recent new york times piece  they called chinatown ""a meditation on evil""  which is spot-on. set in 1937  this movie is just all-round perfect  first and foremost how everything is connected within the grand structure of the movie  that is rich in themes (water  evil  trust  guilt  greed) and even richer in suspense  as the audience—just like our protagonist—tries to find out what is happening. the story is ""complex"" for sure  but it's not ""complicated"". everything makes sense in the end and the complexity pays off big time.besides the impeccable screenplay  everything else about this movie is perfect as well. jack nicholson and faye dunaway carry the movie with sophistication and dignity. dunaway's stunning performance in particular fills every scene with an aura of mystery as you are trying to find out what her motives are. the set pieces are beautiful  the score is compelling; and camera-work and editing could not be any better. there is a reason this one is called a classic! so  if you're ready to delve deep into a richly layered exploration of the dark side of humanity—enjoy the ride. but don't expect to come back unscathed."
"there are only two things wrong with the great escape:(1) there was no sequel.(2) i have never figured out how to get my a-2 flight jacket to look as beat up as the one worn by virgil hilts.mcqueen personifies the american air force officer in ww2.  he is a strong individualist  put off by mickey mouse discipline but has put up with it in order to fly. yet when faced with a political and moral challenge- escaping from a pow camp  or harassing the enemy  both to maintain his dignity and continue the fight  he shows an inner discipline and strong team player mentality.mcqueen's own military experience shows though here and gives real depth and credibility to his character (despite his arrogance  hilts addresses the german commandant by ending each response with ""ya voll  herr oberst"" [yes sir  my colonel]. as he passes the senior british officer [sbo] in the last scene  he nods and acknowledges his superior officer with a simple ""...sir"").  these are traits of an experienced soldier  not an actor reading lines.  mcqueen plays his role this way throughout the movie.like every other mcqueen fan  i keep watching the film again and again  because i know if i do he will eventually jump the motorcycle over the barbed wire fence and head off to freedom.(note:  the character hilts was based upon was an oss agent named sage. sage eventually did escape from another pow camp later in the war  so even though the bike jump wasn't successful  hilts was. somewhat of a consolation).a beautiful elmer bernstein sound track is hauntingly choreographed with stunning german bavarian scenery.  john sturges has assembled his cast of ""usual suspects"": mcqueen  coburn & bronson from previous war and western flicks. sir richard attenborough is superb as ""big x"" the escape committee mastermind  and james garner plays james garner plays james garner...as (bret maverick) the perennial wise cracking thief and scrounger.even after nearly 40 years  i still love watching the intro credits roll and the music start...once the pows jump down from the trucks i'm absorbed into the plot all over again."
"i find it difficult to believe that some reviewers' negative reactions to this film are based on their (misguided) beliefs that none of this could possibly have happened. comments like these make it crystal clear that what some people don't know about history is appalling. if you are going to judge a film based on historical fact  it helps if you know what it is.
it is well-documented what amazing technical feats the pow's were able to accomplish in the stalags. there was even an entire section of the british secret service dedicated to coming up with all sorts of clever ways to send these captured men the tools they needed to facilitate their escape attempts  i.e.  sandwiching maps between the split sides of a record album (yes  the germans allowed the prisoners to have records in the camps) or compasses in pens. at colditz castle  one of the more forbidding stalags  (actually an offlag since is was for officers only)  many  many tunnels were dug and disguises created. one man actually created a german sergeant's uniform totally from scratch  donned a moustache and created an overall impersonation so realistic  it fooled two out of three sets of sentries. some of the pow's built and concealed an entire glider that would have carried two men off the roof and over the wall! the only reason it didn't fly was because the prison was liberated before they got the chance! the colditz experience is well documented. there are many books written about that particular prison complete with photographs  including one by a german officer confirming these amazing escapes and attempts. the reviewers who doubt what can be done when necessity is truly the mother of invention should look for them and learn something. as for the prisoners not being in jumpsuits  as suggested by one reviewer as one reason to question the authenticity of the film? ludicrous  pow's wore what they were captured in. the german military (different from the gestapo and the ss) considered them soldiers and allowed them to keep their badges of rank.as for the film itself  it is long  but absorbing. there are historical flaws (as there are in all movies)  but several of the former pow's participated in the filming process  keeping it  for the most part   very authentic. as for the emphasis on americans  it's true they were not among the escapees per se  but several did assist in the effort before they were transferred out  as mentioned by a previous reviewer. however  you must remember that the movie was made for an american audience in 1963  long before international distribution revenue became so important to a studio's bottom line. they needed american stars who would appeal to an american audience. who knows  perhaps if they were to remake it today  the cast would be all british and german  but i doubt it (see ""hart's war"" where not only the plot  but all the british and canadian characters that were in the book  disappeared).all in all  ""the great escape"" is an entertaining movie telling a fascinating story of what ordinary men can achieve in adverse circumstances. it's well worth the time."
"to kill a mockingbird is presented like a play in three acts. it is also from the children's perspective. through the kids  we find that racism is a learned attitude or feeling. we also see a delightful coming of age drama as the young kids realize that there is no boogeyman down the street and their father is capable of doing a lot more than they think. the great gregory peck plays atticus finch  a pillar of nobility  social conscience  and  rare for 1930's americana  a single parent. peck is such a strong presence  you believe everything about him. it is something you can compare to america's trust in tv anchorman walter cronkite. we always took his word for it.act one puts atticus in the background and allows the kids to flourish. director robert mulligan was able to get such realistic performances from non-professional kids. they are amusing and fun to watch. the big mystery lies in the house down the street in this small georgia town. who is the monstrous  ""6 and a half feet big"" legend living in the end house? some light suspense ensues  while the buildup to a stirring act two is happening. atticus must defend an african-american man for the alleged rape of a white woman.after threats galore  an unshaken peck takes to the courtroom jungle in  without a doubt  one of the top 5 court scenes in motion picture history. brock peters lends the film its best moments as the accused ""negro"" on trial. this man has a face chiseled with suffering and deep  deep sorrow. we know atticus is a good man  a decent human being with a soul. he sees this in his client as well  and in a closing argument that must have roused the civil rights movement  implores the jury to vote justice. an all-male  all-white jury in the 1930's were tough listeners. peters' breakdown on the stand is one of the most realistic  emotionally saddening moments you'll ever see  especially in hollywood films of the 1960's. the scene when peck leaves the courtroom is now legendary as well.act three produces a tragic death  an unlikely hero  and the bringing together of a family. the filmmakers have such a passion for the material  they seem to handle it with gentleness. racism is a hard-boiled subject and it is depicted and dealt with through grace and patience. to kill a mockingbird poses the injustice of race relations in the 1930's as a front for the events happening in the 1960's. the film came out during turbulent times and was also an adaption of a literary classic. i am one to judge a film solely by film only. the book is a separate art form and should not be compared to the film  an art form itself. it is important  it is enlightening  and it has not aged. watch it.rating: 9 of 10"
"the first time i saw to kill a mockingbird was at a drive-in theater.  i was probably about ten or eleven at the time.  even at a young age i was captivated by this seemingly simple story told through the eyes of children that i could easily relate to.  perhaps also it was the fact that the part of the story that dealt with boo radley  held a kind of mystery and an eeriness for me  much in the way a ghost story would.  i'm not about to make the pretense that i understood the social significance of to kill a mockingbird at the age of ten  or even the greatness of the film.  that would come later in life  after having viewed it in one of it's first network television broadcasts.one of the things that makes to kill a mockingbird a truly great film is the love and respect everyone involved in bringing harper lee's novel to the screen had for the original source material.  it shows up on screen in every single frame.  each performance in this film is beyond reproach.  gregory peck had many fine performances over his storied career  but none every approached the perfection he brought to his portrayal of atticus finch.  as atticus  peck brings us the depth of understanding as to how his love for jem and scout enables him to treat his children with respect and honesty. he never talks down to them  but approaches them on a level in which children of their age can comprehend and learn from his own wisdom.  yet  he is still able to retain the same no nonsense approach as other parents. atticus is also a man who believes in the integrity of justice  yet recognizes the failings of our justice system.  when called upon to do his duty  he does so  despite the hatred and venom brought to bear upon him and his children by the citizens of the town in which he lives.in casting jem  scout and dill  producer alan j. pakula and director robert mulligan faced a daunting task.  so much of the success of to kill a mockingbird depended on the pivotal role these characters would play in the film.  for jem he chose philip alford  for scout  mary badham  and for dill  john megna.  alford and badham were both southern natives who had never been in films before.  megna was a new york native but was also inexperienced. it is this inexperience and lack of polish that enables all three to shine on the screen.  mulligan began filming by letting them act as if making a film was like recess  allowing them to play on the set  and only moving the camera gradually as they became accustomed to their surroundings.  it paid off in every way imaginable.  none of the three ever appear as if they are actors acting  and bring a childlike wonder and presence to their roles that i had never seen before  and will unlikely witness again.brock peters as tom robinson  the black man falsely accused of raping a white girl  also gives a performance which he would never again surpass. you will not find anywhere a more memorable scene in any court room than when he testifies on the witness stand.  because he dared to care about a white girl  he now faces almost certain death if convicted  and perhaps even if not convicted.  it is the first time i was able to begin to understand the effects of man's prejudice and hatred of a man simply because of the color of his skin.  just as jem and scout came of age  and realized the significance of the injustices of racial hatred  so did i.equally significant  is collin wilcox as mayella ewell. she makes it easy for many to hate her  but like atticus  we see in her a person to be more pitied than hated.  she is a product of not only the times in which she lives  but even more so of her wretched upbringing.  mayella is what she is  but only because of the deep cutting prejudices of those around her.  to mayella  being caught enticing a black man into your house for relations  is the ultimate crime and the penalty for doing so is unthinkable to her.
in his screen debut as boo radley  robert duvall also brings to life the mysterious neighbor that once frightened jem  dill  and scout so much. though on the screen for a short length of time  without uttering a word  duvall shows us a man tortured by years of cruelty  mistreatment  and the gossip and whispers of neighbors.  he is a man who wants only to live in his own way  yet the bond that links him to jem and scout is significant.  they are the childhood he had never really known.  just as tom robinson  he has never brought harm to anyone  yet suffers significantly just for the right to be able to exist.the care with which to kill a mockingbird was brought to the screen can also be seen in the art direction by henry bumstead and set decoration by oliver emert.  they indeed bring to life what a small southern town would have been like in the early thirties. cinematographer russel harlan's black and white photography brings it all vividly to the screen  especially in the way he captures the foreboding of the radley house  the moments when bob ewell approaches jem when he is left in a car alone  and even more noteworthy near the end of the film when jem and scout are walking home from a school play. elmer bernstein's score is never boisterous  but yet is as important to setting the mood of many of the scenes played out before us.there have been many eloquent words written in many of the comments on this board about to kill a mockingbird. many of the words are far better than those that i have written.  then again  maybe a few simple paragraphs cannot truly describe the significant achievement in film making that to kill a mockingbird is.  it will be forever remembered  long after you and i have departed from this world.  it is at this point that i usually grade a film. i will skip that here  simply because there is no grade that i can give that could possibly do justice for to kill a mockingbird."
"loosely based on dashiell hammett's western novel red harvest and glass key. this jidaigeki (period drama film)  tells the story of an unnamed ronin (toshiro mifune)  who arrives in a small town in 1860 japan  where competing crime lords  seibei  the brothel owner (seizaburô kawazu) and ushitora  the arms dealer (tatsuya nakadai) fight each other for supremacy. the two bosses each try to hire the deadly newcomer as a yojimbo aka bodyguard  but the unnamed ronin has a secret plan to get rid of both of them  by playing both rivals against each other in the hope that they will wipe each other out  faster than ever. without spoiling too much of it  this movie is a great samurai film  that is worth the watch only. the movie is beautiful shot. director akira kurosawa's films are notable for being stunning visually  with beautiful backgrounds  sometimes verging on scenery porn. this movie might not have much of the japanese landscape in the background  but it made great use of the set  and the weather. the way  he know how to use actors in a wide screen frame is amazing. he place actors in the foreground. middle ground in the left or right. sharp focus. director john ford type of a style. he use the shutters and doors  well on the japanese set to reset shots so dynamically. without cutting the shutters and door  create a look of comic book panels  frame by frame. like in most kurosawa films  rainy weather is present in a few scenes  increasing the effect of the characters' discomfort making emotional seem real. the windy weather all throughout the film represents the chaotic life in the town. the wind blowing while yojimbo walks inspired many japanese animes and films. kurosawa originated a lot of film techniques that are still being used today. a form of cinematic punctuation very strongly identified with kurosawa is the wipe as a transitional device. it is used as a substitute for the straight cut or the dissolve. yojimbo had great pan-focus shots  because they were crucial to the action. action shot with a few long shots. it's way different than how action is film  today. this is one reason this movie stands the test of time so well. one thing that the movie does so well is editing. kurosawa was a master in that. he was so good and quick  that yojimbo had its japanese premiere on four days after shooting concluded. still  the movie does have some problems  as its jump back and forth between drama and comedy. it's a bit jarring at times. most of the humor were hits than miss. i love the look of sanjuro aka yojimbo's face when he sees the dog carrying the sever hand. the violence and gore was pretty intense  at times. it's weird to see  bloody limps being chop off in an early 1960s film  seeing how strict  japanese censors were  at the time. the cycles of violence in this film is a lot tamer than that of 1954 seven samurai. yojimbo's script is pretty good  but it lacks the intellectual challenge of 1950's rashomon  the moral resonance of 1952's ikiru  and the sweeping grandeur of seven samurai. he made a couple of great samurai films  but after seeing several of them  they get to be a bit repetitive. most of the villains are forgettable. they are two-dimensional comically idiots without a shred of redeeming humanity thought. kurosawa told tatsuya nakadai that his character was a snake  so nakadai moves very snake-like. it didn't help  as his character has little to no personality at all. i just know him  as the man with the creepy smile  snake motion and the gun. the supporting characters  he helps out aren't memorable. i was really hoping more from the old undertaker and his family. toshiro mifune as the main lead was great. he's not only one of the greatest japanese actors of all-time  but is one of the greatest actors of all-time period. toshiro mifune is a great actor  capable of great range and subtlety of expression. a complete badass  and everybody comes to realize this very quickly. he was able to perform  the way  the director wanted to. akira kurosawa told toshiro mifune to act like a stray dog  which is why he twitches his shoulders and scratches himself a lot during the film. the character of sanjiro can be viewed as an early example of the ""man with no name"" because he made the name up at the shot. kurosawa was often criticized by his countrymen for perceived ""arrogant"" behavior  and you see that in this character. in many ways  the main lead character mirrors kurosawa at the time. claims of personal arrogance and harsh treatment of colleagues were often  said about the director. he could even sometimes be hard on seasoned  highly respected film professionals. during the filming of this  he lost his temper with one of japan's preeminent cinematographer kazuo miyagawa. he was often  very tiresome  during filming. this movie would be  one of his last best influencing films. still  it's been years since this movie first came out  but it's still influencing how films are made today. in 1964  yojimbo was remade as sergio leone's a fistful of dollars  a spaghetti western starring clint eastwood as the man with no name. leone and his production company failed to secure the remake rights to kurosawa's film  resulting in a lawsuit that delayed the western release for three years. the movie influenced a lot of other movies in the west over time like 1996's walter hill gangster film  ""last man standing"" and others. the movie even got a sequel  1962's sanjuro. the music from this film by masaru satô is very powerful to listen

only a handful of directors know atmosphere the way akira kurosawa does  only a handful. yojinbo opens with a tracking shot of a ronin samurai walking down a dusty road. the camera wisely stays behind the samurai  played by toshiro mifune  so we cannot see his face or expressions. this samurai is desperate. mifune has no master and no money. kurosawa doesn't let you see his desperation  instead focusing on the back of his head and his profile to set up one of the most memorable characters in cinema history. the film has been copied many times  its practically the most influential film of the modern action genre. yojinbo isn't action packed however  kurosawa takes his time setting up characters and plot. the fact that this masterless samurai has deep compassion for strangers is different than most modern action movies alone. toshiro mifune is magical in the lead role. his presence is felt all throughout the film even when he isn't on camera. all film buffs should watch this film  it is a perfect example of a director and actor with confidence in their craft.
"i'd been meaning to see this movie since i can remember but never made it happen until it was on pbs last night. what makes this movie a classic is the message it conveys as well as the way it conveys it. the screenplay has many layers and makes it's points very subtlety-as a first generation american of parents who were both concentration camp survivors  the message had particular meaning for me. it's a message especially poignant as americans today better understand the pitfalls of confusing constructive political criticism/dissent with not being patriotic -and putting political party before country.""the only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing""  is a quote attributed to edmund burke- and is entirely what ""judgement at nuremberg"" is all about. what happened in nazi germany is not confined to the german people  it could happen in almost any country of the world  given the right circumstances. the defense ""i was just following orders"" is without merit.... -that is  if we are serious about wanting to live in a society we can be proud of.spencer tracy is so good in this movie it's difficult to put into words. his role is a very delicate one and he pulls it off like few actors in history could ever hope to. tracy's role is all the more impressive in the company of scores of hollywood stars that grace this film.there are weaknesses in the movie. i was surprised that  even given the subject matter  i found ""judgement at nuremberg"" too often melodramatic- the pacing and dialog often so slow that it bordered on comical. in this regard director stanley kramer overdoes it imho.spoiler: the full weight of the story is brought to bear at the end when the guilty verdicts are given. spencer tracy  as the lead judge  pronounces the sentences on the nazi government officials. many of the accused officials are unrepentant and antagonistic to the idea of being judged by the american court  but burt lancaster plays the role of a german official who takes shame in his actions during the war.lancaster was a nazi court judge who allowed himself to take orders from party officials. his testimony shows that he did things against his better judgment and we see him as a relatively good man who got caught up in the political momentum and nazi system.when tracy pronounces life sentences to the hard core nazi's  he does so in a voice that betrays little emotion or anger. when he gets to lancaster's character you're expecting tracy to be more lenient on him  but instead he raises his voice in great anger and emotion as he also sentences him to life imprisonment. tracy was angrier with him because he expected more from lancaster -because he knew better yet didn't act.in the last scene lancaster is a broken man seeking some form of forgiveness from the man who sentenced him  and asks to see tracy in his cell-room. tracy obliges and takes his time to listen. lancaster expresses his sorrow and pleads for the judge to understand that no one could have predicted the incredible evil that resulted from the nazi regime... as the times were so chaotic it was impossible to not get caught up in it all. ""i couldn't know"".as lancaster is broken and repentant  one is tempted to forgive him for his actions. the camera goes to spencer tracy- he pauses and  with a soft voice  respectfully states... ""you should have known as soon as you sentenced men to die who you knew were innocent"". understanding the point is inescapably true- lancaster's face falls  tracy leaves and the movie ends.it's powerful stuff and a poignant lesson for all of us who like to think of ourselves as ""good people""."
this quote is one of the most shocking and yet truthful quotes i have ever heard. it is one of many shocking and intense quotes in the movie. furthermore judgment at nuremburg is one of the most absorbing movies i have seen. even though most if not all of it is dialog it is very much a haunting film. this film is loosely based on the trials in nuremburg in 1948. right from the start the movie captures your mind and never lets it go. the acting was collectively amazing. one of the best casts ever assembled which included spencer tracy  montgomery clift  judy garland  richard widmark  burt lancaster as well as international stars maximilian schell and marlene dietrich. it is not just the fact that this is a star studded cast that made it so great  it was the way everyone appeared to blend in together. maximilian schell gave the performance of his life in this film playing the defense lawyer for burt lancaster who give two superb narratives that will certainly stay in your mind forever. schell's character use of logic is that of something which will mesmerize use you whether or not you agree or disagree with what he says. richard widmark playing the prosecutor gave the type of supporting performance that was necessary for schell to shine. the way both actors fed off each other was a joy to watch. then of course the tiny appearances of garland and clift were excellent and worth every second they spent on camera. i usually find myself frustrated with cameos and actors receiving recognition for them but this film used cameos the best way i have ever seen. then of course spencer tracy and marlene dietrich provided such great presence were perfect for the lead.the direction of stanley kramer was spectacular as the film intensified more and more as it wore on. it was always engrossing and never let up. the writing of abby mann was great  filled up with great material and narratives allowing every actor in the cast to give a superb performance. there were many memorable quotes as well. the writing carried the film forward and allowed all the potential and talent to push this film to another level.judgement at nuremburg is not just another movie. it is a very thought provoking movie. more than that though it is haunting. just thinking about the course of the events being talked about in the movie became subtly haunting in a way i really didn't expect. what was the most compelling though was the way we need to separate what we feel with what has to be truly done  with what is truly right.
legendary comedy masterpiece from filmmaker billy wilder and ial diamond that won oscar and another 13 wins & 8 nominations . immensely charming comedy set among chicago and miami   being starred by an all-star-cast . when two unemployed musicians witness a mob hit   the st valentine massacre in chicago carried out by mobster chief (george raft) they flee the state in an all female band disguised as women and headed for florida   but further complications set in. there appears a gorgeous singer   sugar kane (marilyn monroe)   who is object of pursuit by the musicians (jack lemmon   tony curtis) who cannot reveal their identity because are dressed as women in order to getaway from killer gangsters' retaliation . rightly enjoyable and fun-filled   milestone comedy which neatly combines humor   mirth   entertaining situations and amusement . this noisy comedy is intelligently and pleasingly written to gives us lots of fun   laughters and smiles . mordantly funny   though by time of premiere was rated as bad taste and some discomfort ; however   is todays considered a real classic movie . billy wilder kept the studio paramount happy   the picture consistently made money and was hit at box office . flawless comedy with a trio of sensational protagonists   including an unforgettable marilyn who parades sexily at her best and more relaxed and enticing than ever . the hit of the show is undoubtedly for the fetching marilyn monroe who gives one of the best screen acting and sings marvelous songs as ¨running wild¨  ¨i'm through with love¨ and the immortal ¨i wanna be loved you¨. magnificent performances from jack lemmon as angst-ridden musician dressed in drag and sensational tony curtis as a philander young   playing his gary gray grant impression . furthermore   a splendid secondary cast   a variety of notorious actors who make sympathetic interpretations such as pat o'brien   george raft   mike mazurski   nehemia persoff and   of course  smitten joe e brown   including his now-classic closing line . the motion picture was very well directed by billy wilder who includes several punchlines . billy was one of the best directors of history . in 1939 started the partnership with charles bracket on such movies as ¨ninotchka¨   ¨ball of fire¨   making their film debut as such with ¨major and the minor¨ . ¨sunset boulevard¨ was their last picture together before they split up . later on   billy collaborated with another excellent screenwriter ial diamond . both of them won an academy award for ¨stalag 17¨ dealing with a pow camp starred by william holden . after that   they wrote/produced/directed such classics as ¨ace in the hole¨   the touching romantic comedy ¨sabrina¨   the hickcoktian courtroom puzzle game ¨witness for the prosecution¨ and two movies with the great star marilyn monroe   the warmth ¨seven year itch¨ and this ¨some like hot¨. all of them include screenplays that sizzle with wit . but their biggest success and highpoint resulted to be the sour and fun ¨¨the apartment¨. subsequently in the 60s and 70s   the duo fell headlong into the pit   they realized nice though unsuccessful movies as ¨buddy buddy¨  ¨fedora¨   ¨front page¨ and ¨secret life of sherlock holmes¨  though the agreeable ¨avanti¨ slowed the decline . the team had almost disappeared beneath a wave of bad reviews and failures . ¨some like hot¨ rating : above average   essential and indispensable watching ; extremely funny and riveting film and completely entertaining . it justly deserves its place among the best comedy ever made . one of the very funniest films of all time and to see and see again . it's the kind of movie where you know what's coming but   because the treatment   enjoy it all the same .
"why a man would want to marry another man? asks tony curtis  security! jack lemmon replays without missing a beat. clearly he had put the question to himself before and had arrived to a perfectly sensible conclusion. everything in this gem of a movie had been thought so cleverly and as it turned out so prophetically  that the world of our three characters  a world of prohibition and gang wars could be today and more than likely will be tomorrow. billy wilder analyzes human nature with an acid eye and a glorious panache for underlining our most endearing features. our frailties. marilyn monroes is at her pick  the sadness in her eyes a startling metaphor in a comedy about wanting. tony curtis with an eve arden's pout is so beautiful  so charming  imitating cary grant and trying to be himself that  in my mind he'll be always be in a frock. and  of course  jack lemmon  throwing himself into the part  body and should. only perfection can allow to end its course with a line like ""nobody's perfect"""
"this is a film school movie; one of the greatest ever made  or so say the experts. i was told to read the play (the english title is ""wild strawberries"") in a lit class in college and then we were given the chance to see the film. i watched both showings and it changed my thinking about what makes a good movie. this was in the stone age back in '75. i was a wild boy about campus who's taste for films was more action/adventure  western and mystery/suspense. the funny thing about wild strawberries is there's a little of all those genre's in it (if you understand what a cowboy bergmann was at this point in his career).this is the story about the late-life introspection of an elderly physician. it really appears on the surface to be about as dull a concept for a film as one could ever want to suffer through. but this is a story about facing reality  and reality is rarely dull. the plot moves seamlessly through many phases  but much of it involves a road trip through the swedish countryside.i recently bought a dvd of the 70's cult car-chase flick ""vanishing point""; i hadn't seen it since the drive-in in my college years. i also own a criterion collection copy of wild strawberries and i've watched both recently. i realized that wild strawberries is a car chase flick as well. but bergmann's isak is not running from war weariness but from a life of nihilism cloaked in the old-world respectability of a family doctor. the chase is his lifetime of self-certainty  agnosticism and increasing isolation finally catching up to him. he realizes that he has been a walking dead man for much of his life (something he partially inherited from his mother). getting too far into the details may fall into the category of being a spoiler  although there is enough complexity in this plot to keep literature classes struggling for an a for a long time (note: the stage play script is exactly the same as the screenplay script).there are a number of notable scenes in the movie that make this day a turning point in the life of the doctor. the ground-breaking dream sequences in the beginning is hitchcock-like and terrifyingly surreal (or is hitch being bergmannesque?). of great beauty is the reverie scene  where isak relives some of his childhood while making a stop at his families' deserted summer lake house. the dialog scenes between isak and his daughter-in-law  and later with the almans (including another disturbing dream sequence) and with the ""children"" (hitchhiking college-age kids) are all filled with symbols and conversation pointing to isak's living-dead existence.it's interesting that bergmann himself  at this point in his young career  was much like isak; agnostic  distant  self-absorbed  incapable of intimacy. yet his conclusion to wild strawberries is much more hopeful than what bergmann's own life has been.the turning point of the movie  easy to miss if you're not paying close attention  is the love-promise from the young hitchhiker sara; a moment of incredible sweetness and innocent passion that is a regeneration  a salvation experience for isak. unlike bergmann  isak closes his eyes that night with the hope of a life of meaning  of love in service  not just service for maintaining personal dignity and image. unlike bergmann  isak has a hope of seeing god when his death does arrive  and has demonstrated a new life has begun. this is isak's today; his day of repentance  of stopping the tortuous task of hardening his heart against the call of life  yielding in submission to love  mercy and grace.watch this one several times. bergmann's troupe of actors are incredible  his cinematography is spartan and overwhelmingly effective; his location shooting in the beautiful swedish summer is fascinatingly effective in giving a foreign yet ""down-home"" feeling that's almost mayberry like  if that's not too extreme a comparison.this movie shows the dichotomy of living for self versus living for the service of others. isak thought he lived to serve but discovered that service is only of meaning to the server if it is from the heart. it is ultimately a hopeful picture that we can all learn from if we watch with an open heart. otherwise  we see the wasted tragedy of existential living with no greater good than one's own dead image. does your watch have any hands?"
"i'd seen ""wild strawberries"" as a college freshman when it was first released  and knew right away i'd be a bergman fan from then on. 
i watched it again just last night  january 2004  at age 63  and needless to say got a whole different perspective on the film.  where the surrealist touches  moody photography  and incredibly smooth direction had made the big hit with me as a near boy  as an aging man i found myself--i hesitate to say painfully  but...well  closely--identifying with old isak borg in his strange pilgrimage  both interior and exterior  the day he receives his honorary degree at the cathedral in lund.in the last twenty minutes or so of the movie  i found tears running down my face  not from any thrilling sentimental browbeating (i doubt if mr. bergman shot five seconds' worth of sentimentality in his whole long career!) but simply from the cumulative emotional impact of this simple  powerful story and its probing revelation of human character  desire  and chagrin. 
by the time the film ended  i felt wrung out  disoriented  happy and deeply sad at the same time: it's the experience the greeks wanted their tragedies to convey to the spectator; they spoke of ""katharsis.""  i experienced it firsthand when i had the great good fortune to see a production (in english) of ""medea.""  i walked away in tears and scarcely able to think straight for an hour or so.  the same thing happened with ""wild strawberries.""  this is one of the handful of films i unhesitatingly rate a ""ten.""a side note: i watched the criterion collection dvd.  before the film itself  i watched the hour-long interview conducted in 1998 by jorn donner included on the disc.  it was remarkable to see how the film bergman shot ca. 1957 contains many elements that were to be present in his later life--like a foreshadowing of his own old age."
"i find it strange that ""the seventh seal"" has always been widely considered to be the best bergman movie and is so much more famous that all the others he made. yes  it's very good  especially for its time  but compared with the real masterpieces bergman made like ""wild strawberries""  ""through a glass darkly""  ""persona""  ""winter light"" and ""fanny and alexander""  it really pales in comparison. the ideas and the questions asked in this movie are pretty interesting and profound  but i feel that bergman has done so much better in his later movies on similar subjects. the theme about the god's silence is much  much better developed in the famous ""faith trilogy""  especially ""through a glass darkly"" and ""winter light"". the theme about how to cope with fear of death is well developed  but couldn't really convince me. also i feel that the film has too many ""comic relief"" moments.  many people have praised the cinematography in this movie  quite a few saying that it's one of the best ever. i beg to disagree. it's very  very good  excellent at times  but again bergman has done so much better in his other movies. personally i feel that the cinematography in bergman's movies improved when he changed his director of photography gunnar fischer(who worked on this movie and ""wild strawberries"") with sven nykvist. watch ""through a glass darkly"" or ""persona"" if you want a really stunning cinematography. but even ""wild strawberries""  made shortly after ""the seventh seal"" and looking visually quite similar  is better imo. here the settings and the lighting looks too theatrical to me for most of the times. of course  there were quite a few memorable images  especially the start with death on the beach  the dance with death at the end  the procession of the fanatics who whipped themselves through the village etc. but still  something was lacking in many of the scenes. bergman had to shoot the whole movie in just 35 days  so it's understandable imo. after being so critical to the movie so far  it's time to mention its strong points. they are typical of bergman's movies. very strong acting(especially from max von sydov)  amazing dark medieval atmosphere  really makes you think about the important questions. the music was very well and effectively used too. it's a great movie  no doubt  and it established bergman as one of the all-time greats  which is big plus for a huge fan of him like myself. still  my advice is: don't limit your bergman experience to just this movie  watch his others  many of them are even better. 9/10"
"middle ages: antonius blok  a swedish knight  returns from the crusades only to find his country dying of the plague  religious fundamentalists taking over and death himself wanting him to come along. antonius challenges death to a game of chess and is meanwhile driven to desperation because of the absence of god. this description sounds like a very serious  philosophical and dour film  and actually it is serious  philosophical and dour; but there is also a little warmth  hope and humor  maybe not for antonius  but for the viewer.when blok and death interrupt their game of chess (due to the plague  death is very busy)  he meets two actors  jof and mia  with their little son  the most human characters of the film  and i don't think it's a coincidence that there names sound very much like joseph and mary. these people may be a little dim  but they are good at heart and you can see the happiness in antonius' eyes when he is together with them for the first time.
but the main aspect of ingmar bergman's arguably best film are antonius blok's grim encounters  as the young girl about to be burnt at the stake  as a scapegoat for the plague. and the haunting image of a huge crowd of flagellants interrupting a play of jof and mia and trying to convince the crowd thery are doomed; hardly any other film is that direct in asking controversial and essential questions about god  religion and mankind as the seventh seal.another reason for the impact this almost 50-year-old film has still today is the acting: max von sydow's face always seems to reflect what antonius blok is thinking  nils poppe's performance as the naive actor and caring father is priceless and bengt ekerot's death became a part of film history and survived all its spoofs (the best one being in woody allen's tremendously funny ""love and death""). but the best performance is done by gunnar björnstrand as antonios blok's misogynist squire  dryly commenting all their encounters even in the face of death.the seventh seal is not subtle in raising it's questions  that's for sure. but it makes you think about these questions nevertheless. it's disturbing and grim most of the time  but at the end it gives you the hope that it might become better."
"rififi (jules dassin - france 1955)to me  it seems a very risky idea to attempt a hollywood-remake of jules dassin's 1955 classic rififi. planned for release in 2007  al pacino apparently is gonna play the lead  taking on the role of tony le stephanois. risky business... how they're gonna pull this off?ironically  dassin was blacklisted in hollywood and went on to try his luck in france and made this little masterpiece  aptly called by some ""the grandddady of all caper- and heist movies"". in my opinion  it remains a one-of-a-kind classic  beautifully filmed with one of the most memorable endings ever to be put on film. whatever one's opinion of the film.in the last couple of years rififi has become dangerously overpraised. nevertheless  this french noir-classic shouldn't be forgotten. go see it  before the remake is out there  in order to have some ammunition for comparing the two.camera obscura --- 9/10"
"du rififi chez les hommes/rififi(1955) can on the surface be described as a french variation on john huston's seminal heist film  asphalt jungle(1950). the difference between the two films is rififi(1955) pays a little more attention in detail to the robbery sequence.  also  the police aren't involved in the aftermath of the robbery in rififi as much as in asphalt jungle.  in the end rififi(1955) is in my opinion a slightly better film than asphalt jungle(1950).  remarkable noir picture that defines 1950s french cinema.
spartacus(1960) may have been the one which broke down the infamous blacklist  but in my opinion rififi(1955) was the film that began to break apart the unbreakable hollywood blacklist.  first film in five years for jules dassin who was victimized by the mccarthy communist hunt of the late 40s to early 50s.  he got some sort of retribution when rififi(1955) became a success around france and europe.  thus defying the poisonious hollywood blacklist in a major way that probably inspired others to do the same. rififi(1955) is the most important film of dassin's career because it not only restored his name  but also gave him a second chance at making films.
jules dassin gave the filmworld and its ever growing audiences a masterpiece of influential proportions.  his handling of the material is exceptional and direction of the actors is flawless.  builds up tense situations with precise craftsmanship.  dassin came full circle in the film noir genre by directing his best and last noir  rififi(1955).  marked the end of dassin's period in filmmaking when he was involved in doing noir pictures.
rififi(1955) is the number one film in an arsenal of thirty plus films for director  jules dassin.  a masterpiece in acting  cinematography  directing  editing  and writing.  not a film to leave your seat for one minute because there is always something memorable going on.  as brilliant as anything by jean pierre melville who was a master of this type of film.  masterpieces such as rififi(1955) are relatively small compared to the probably billions of films made in motion picture history.
the one fascinating aspect of rififi is the precise planning and careful execution of a robbery that takes up a bulk of the 118 minute duration. the main characters plan and execute the jewel heist in the same way a film director prepares for the pre-productions  production  and post-production of a film.  shows how difficult a jewel heist like in rififi(1955) is in committing and why very few would do something like it.  the fact that the scene hardly contains a mess up like in other heist films turns this scene into something even greater.  close as one can get to having a perfect sequence in a motion picture.
lack of unnatural sound in the landmark thrity minute heist sequence puts it in a realm of absolute realism.  any dialogue or/and music would ruin any suspense and tension the director is trying to create.  the use of natural sound makes the heist sequence a rewarding film viewing experience.  now filmmakers and producers would use dialogue and music in a scene like this because of a lack of confidence of a mainstream filmgoer's patience. sustains a level of consistency that never once lets down.
maintaining a high level of suspense is what makes the heist sequence tick to perfection.  the director achieves suspense in the heist sequence that's rarely equaled in most robbery scenes from heist films.  jean servais and the rest of the main actors contribute to the suspense with some low key acting.  getting suspense put in a scene is a task few are capable of doing. the robbery sequence of rififi(1955) reaches a hitchcockian level of suspense and tension.
many filmmakers from the years following du rififi chez les hommes(1955) have been influenced if not inspired by it.  one filmmaker influenced was jean pierre melville(original choice for director of rififi)who used variations of the heist sequence in le doulos(1961)  and le cercle rouge(1970).  another filmmaker influenced was stanley kubrick who made a similarly themed film in the killing(1956).  also  quentin tarantino whose debut feature reservoir dogs(1992) was inspired by this film.  other film directors influenced are john woo  michael mann  paul schrader  ringo lam  etc...
du rififi chez les hommes(1955) is comparable to bob le flambeur(1955) in many ways.  one  jules dassin and jean pierre melville directed groundbreaking films in rififi(1955) and bob le flambeur(1955).  two  each film involves an aging criminal who plans and carries out a daring heist. three  bob le flambeur and rififi finishes in fatalistic fashion.  four  each film shares many motifs and situations that classify the two as film greats.
part of rififi's charm are the colorful characters that surround the story such as tony le stephanois  jo le suedois  mario farrati  and cesar le milanais.  most of the violence is implicit yet effectively brutal.  the main characters led by tony le stephanois abide by a strong outdated code of honor that is remindful of sam peckinpah and john woo.  jean servais becomes the role of tony le stephanois with his cynical outlook and tired looks. du rififi chez les hommes/rififi(1955) became a favorite of mine the moment i saw it on the big screen from beginning to end."
mostly enjoyable movie  but hardly a 'great' movie. i am most disappointed by the lack of depth in the grace kelly and cummings characters  which are both one-note uninteresting roles. grace kelly is wasted in a passive  weak  and vapid role which relegates her to the status of window dressing (not that there is anything wrong with that!)  she might as well be a nice looking piece of furniture in this movie. the cummings role is wasted as the passion between him and kelly is not developed  and amazingly  the tension that would exist between milland and cummings is never apparent!. this guy was sleeping with milland's wife  but you would think they were best friends. what a waste. would have been a lot more interesting if kelly and cummings were not such bland  cardboard harmless people and were a little more human  with real emotions (jealousy  hatred  passion  even a little evil).milland makes the move interesting to watch as he sets his plan in motion with great charm and flair. unfortunately  as he is the only interesting character  you kind of feel bad when he is caught in the end and the two sappy characters prevail. oh well  it could have been a lot more 'noir' if they had not glossed over the fact that kelly and cummings are far from the sweet innocents they are portrayed.
it takes place almost entirely in one room  and the dialogue  acting and direction is fantastic throughout.time has not diminished this gem and it deserves its fame and status.
"i first watched tokyo story in a classroom some time ago and witnessed something curious. i have never seen a group of people so choked up over a film  ever. the most curious thing about it though is that most could not place what exactly made them so emotional. there are moments in tokyo story in which you are hit with a wall of emotions  surprised and overwhelmed that this simple little film could evoke such feelings. it's something about the characters  the honesty  the way everything hits home despite the cultural and time-period barriers.tokyo story takes a deep look at familial relations in postwar japan. simply  it boils down to this: two aging parents (played by ryu chishu and higashiyama chieko) live far away from their children  who are in a quickly modernizing tokyo. the children in tokyo are quite selfish and focused on their own busy lives in the hustle-and-bustle of the city. the key character in this film  though  is noriko (hara setsuko)  the widow of one of the parents' sons who died in the war. noriko turns out to be more active with her husband's parents than their own children are.the parents decide to make their first  and possibly final  trip to tokyo in order to see their children and view the spectacle of the city. the only person that can make significant time for them  however  is noriko; the children are busy with work and even send their parents away to a spa! in one heartfelt scene  the mother  tomi  spends the night at noriko's in which she begs her to re-marry and apologizes for the burden that her son has caused. during this time  the father  shukichi  is out drinking with old friends and admits to them that he is disappointed with his children  agreeing with his friends who feel the same way.ozu yasujiro is considered to be one of the world's greatest filmmakers and tokyo story is considered his masterpiece. there is no reason to deny this. ozu's camera is often a topic of discussion–it usually sets itself at the level of people sitting on the floor (tatami)  which allows the viewer to feel like they are sitting right with the characters. it is usually always a calm camera  and very rarely pans. his films are also often slowly paced and meditative  choosing to avoid showing important events which later are revealed through dialogue. ozu's direction of children has always been brilliant  they are never a weak point in his films and he often bases his stories on child characters (though not here).tokyo story contains all of the elements that make ozu's films popular with film students and cinephiles today. his calm  observant camera; his real-life  non-embellished characters; his attention to detail and the emotional emphasis on certain objects; his perfectly timed music; among other things  contribute ultimately to the warmth and effectiveness of the film. ozu's passion for filmmaking knew no bounds.tokyo story will not appeal to everybody  especially today. the typical moviegoer will either dismiss the film because it is ""old"" or ""black and white "" or find it boring. to the cautious and attentive viewers who allow themselves to connect with the characters and feel the story  tokyo story is a rewarding experience. tokyo story  along with ozu's other films  is a good example of film as an art. aimed at telling a story and depicting true life on camera  it is much less of the ""entertainment"" experience that people have come to expect from the movies today. there are no explosions  violence  chase scenes  or over- the-top characters here. this is ozu. this is one of the greatest films ever made."
"i think this movie is amazing for reasons i was not expecting. i had heard of yasujiro ozu's ""tokyo story"" for several years but never had an opportunity to see it until criterion resuscitated it as part of their dvd collection. over fifty years old  this wondrous 1953 film resonates just as deeply today. those outside japan rarely get to see a japanese film classic that doesn't involve samurai warriors in medieval battles. this one  however  is a subtly observed family drama set in post-wwii japan  and it is the quietude and lack of pretense of ozu's film-making style that makes this among the most moving of films.the plot centers on shukishi and tomi  an elderly couple  who traverse the country from their southern fishing village of onomichi to visit their adult children  daughter shige and son koichi  in tokyo. leading their own busy lives  the children realize their obligation to entertain them and pack them off to atami  a nearby resort targeted to weekend revelers. returning to tokyo unexpectedly  tomi visits their kindly daughter-in-law  noriko  the widow of second son shoji  while shukishi gets drunk with some old companions. the old couple realizes they have become a burden to their children and decide to return to onomichi. they also have a younger daughter kyoko  a schoolteacher who lives with them  and younger son keizo works for the train company in osaka. by now the children  except for kyoko and the dutiful noriko  have given up on their parents  even when tomi takes ill in osaka on the way back home. from this seemingly convoluted  trivial-sounding storyline  fraught with soap opera possibilities  ozu has fashioned a heartfelt and ultimately ironic film that focuses on the details in people's lives rather than a single dramatic situation.what fascinates me about ozu's idiosyncratic style is how he relies on insinuation to carry his story forward. in fact  some of the more critical events happen off-camera because ozu's simple  penetrating observations of these characters' lives remain powerfully insightful without being contrived. ozu scholar david desser  who provides insightful commentary on the alternate audio track  explains this concept as ""narrative ellipses""  ozu's singularly effective means of providing emotional continuity to a story without providing all the predictable detail in between. ozu also positions his camera low throughout his film to replicate the perspective of someone sitting on a tatami mat. it adds significantly to the humanity he evokes. there are no melodramatic confrontations among the characters  no masochistic showboating  and the dialogue is deceptively casual  as even the most off-hand remark bears weight into the story. the film condemns no one and its sense of inevitability carries with it only certain resigned sadness. what amazes me most is how the ending is so cathartic because the characters feel so real to me  not because there are manipulative plot developments  even death  which force me to feel for them.i just love the performances  as they have a neo-realism that makes them all the more affecting. chishu ryu and chieko higashiyama are wonderfully authentic as shukishi and tomi  perfectly conveying the resignation they feel about their lives and their children without slipping into cheap sentimentality. higashiyama effortlessly displays the sunny demeanor of a grandmother  so when sadness does take over in her life  it becomes all the more haunting. in particular  she has a beautiful scene where tomi looks forlornly at her grandchild wondering what he will be when he grows up and whether she will live to see what happens. even more heartbreaking is the scene where shukishi and tomi sit in ueno park realizing their children have no time for them and are resigned to the fact that they need to find a place to sleep for the night. the closest the film has to a villain is shige  portrayed fearlessly by haruko sugimura  who is able to show respect  pettiness and conniving in a realistically mercurial fashion. watch her as she complains about the expensive cakes her husband bought for her parents (as she selfishly eats them herself) or how she finagles koichi to co-finance the trip to atami or how she shows her frustration when her parents come home early from the spa. so yamamura (familiar to later western audiences as admiral yamamoto in ""tora! tora! tora!"") displays the right amount of indifference as koichi  and kyoko kagawa has a few sharp lines toward the end of the film as the disappointed kyoko.but the best performance comes from the legendary setsuko hara  a luminous actress whose beauty and sensitivity remind me of olivia de havilland during the same era. as noriko  she is breathtaking in showing her character's modesty  her unforced generosity in spite of her downscale status and her constant smile as a mask for her pain. she has a number of deeply affecting moments  for instance  when noriko explains to shukishi and tomi how she misses her husband  even though it is implied he was a brutalizing alcoholic; or the touching goodbye to kyoko; or her pained embarrassment over the high esteem that shukishi holds for her kindness. don't expect fireworks or any shocking moments  just a powerfully emotional film in spite of its seemingly modest approach. the two-disc dvd set has the commentary from desser on the first disc  as well as the trailer. on the second disc  there are two excellent documentaries. one is a comprehensive 1983  two-hour feature focused on ozu's life and career  and the second is a 40-minute tribute from several international movie directors."
as oppose to its commonplace plot  rashomon as a concept is extraordinarily idiosyncratic and perhaps it is this striking attribute that makes it an undisputed masterpiece  howsoever improbable. it vividly limns the artistry of contrivance innate in the human psyche owing to the importunate desire of humans to placate their insatiable egos. this manipulation of facts has no limits and entirely depends upon the skill of imaginative improvisation of the individual along with his level of comfort at skullduggery. the ability to misinterpret comes naturally to the humans as a desperate ploy to counter the adversities of life and that's what makes it indispensable. as a direct consequence of contrivance  the concept of truth no longer remains universal but becomes rather subjective and a matter of individualistic perception. rashomon pioneered kurosawa's dream tryst with perpetual brilliance and undoubtedly played a pivotal part in making his name a mark of excellence in the world of cinema. rashomon is a well knitted tale about a supercilious samurai  his whimsical wife and a boorish bandit. the bandit inveigles the samurai into imprisonment and has his way with samurai's wife. the dead body of the samurai is later discovered under mysterious circumstances by a woodcutter. the bandit is captured and arraigned along with the deranged widow of the samurai. their narrated versions seem such contrasting that a psychic is called upon to conjure up the dead samurai's spirit to record his testimony in order to corroborate the facts that seemed excessively manipulated. the samurai's version yet again differs considerably from the testimonies of the other two. each version though different seemed to satiate the respective ego of the testifier. the woodcutter  who didn't want to get involved personally  later confesses to a priest to have actually witnessed the incident and comes up with a version of his own which falsifies the other three. the movie is ingenious as its actual motive has nothing to do with the revelation of truth as verity is merely a matter of lame perception  but rather is to highlight the discrepancies among the different versions as a medium to depict the irrational complexities associated with the human psyche. the concept of rashomon though well ahead of its time  sowed the seeds for creative innovation in the world of cinema and has served as the undisputed benchmark of innovative excellence for well over five decades. a quintessential kurosawa classic  strongly recommended to the masses for its sheer brilliance and enigmatic charm. 10/10
'people forget the unpleasant things.  they only remember what they want to remember.'in rashomon the editing tells ½ of the story.  it may feel experimental or unconventional  but kurosawa perfects the concept second by second  directing and editing.  this film didn't need a big budget to come perfectly to the point.  it's a simple tale  but not a superficial tale.  different points of view and selective memories ('it's true! i saw it!') don't only make the woods unsafe  but are one of the most universal topics of humanity. 'we humans are weak creatures. that's why we lie  even to ourselves' says it all actually: it's about what people want to hear and when they start being interested at all  apart from wishful thinking.  selfish excuses vs trust in other people.rashomon gets masterful when in one instant there is literally a different point of view: the camera takes another position to shoot the same sequence  thereby forcing the audience to reconsider what they just saw.  that is the sort of storytelling that the supposed masters of cinema in our time yet have to equal  or try to copy when they fail.  admitted 'memento' (2000  nolan) is a truly great one.  still not that universal.  'pulp fiction' (1994) didn't come close   'la commare secca' (1962) also didn't.  'ghost dog: the way of the samurai' (1999) touched another border of the concept  or does it?the use of (non-original) music in my opinion reveals a certain interest for western influence  not only in rashomon  but also in kurosawa's forthcoming films  and is probably why his films were so influential on western filmmakers too.the cinematography is dynamic and changes scene by scene to emphasize exactly what is going on.  the shadows of leaves and branches  captured by cinematographer kazuo miyagawa  make you really feel 'in the woods'  while the actors (toshirô mifune  takashi shimura) convince the remaining part of the audience (which adds up to 100% breathless viewers).  it may be after days that you first realize you saw an important film.  after weeks you realize that you must see it again to comprehend (despite it's only 85 min)  and ironically that is just one of the crucial points that kurosawa made. 10/10
"""all about eve"" is the kind of movie that blows your mind  not because of special effect or something like that  but because of what movies are all about  a great direction  a great screenplay  and great acting.stage star margo channing(davis) is friend to playwright lloyd richards(marlowe) and his wife karen(holm)  in love with director bill samson(merill)  and the idol of eve harrington(baxter) who becomes her secretary-aide. eve begins to dominate: she sends bill margo's birthday wishes and arranges a party for him  at which point margo explodes. eve becomes margo's understudy and  when margo misses a performance  critic addison dewitt gives her rave reviews while making acerbic remarks about aging actresses like margo.in it's first scenes  you can see an unusual style in this kind of movie  and it doesn't look old  even nowadays. the plot is not very entertaining  but the dialogues and the acting grabs your attention  and some quotes leave you speechless to describe how good they are  and it's memorable scenes  like the dialogues between eve and bill about the theater  and the last scene  which is probably the best one  are awesome.the acting is almost perfect by all it's cast  except for marilyn monroe's short appearance  that with three or four lines  can show that she is not in the same acting level of the rest of the cast. bette davis is what really stands out (although george sanders as dewitt is almost as good as her)  she's funny  and know where to show her emotions  and when to hide it.verdict: almost everything works  and it's a classic that should not be missed."
"in show business  there is probably an eve harrington born every day. someone who butters up to a performer of note  acting innocently  revealing none of the coldhearted ambition they really have.  anne baxter plays this type of person to a tee.  she looks like a baby-faced fan  but little do we know  there is a fame machine at work in her mind.  bette davis  as margo channing  star of the stage  is a veteran who has seen it all.  she is quite the egotist.  margo is a brilliant actress and she knows it.  eve discovers her blind spot and moves in on her like a quiet storm.  this is the premise of all about eve  joseph l. mankiewicz's masterpiece of sly wit and subtle manipulation.  mankiewicz also wrote the picture (winner of the best picture oscar of 1950) with such skill  the talented cast need only to memorize the lines and deliver them with the proper technique.the performances are great  regardless  especially by bette davis and the always detested george sanders  one of my favorite actors of the golden age of hollywood.  the film is narrated initially by sanders  who plays a ruthless swine of a theatre critic  then by celeste holm  the wife of eve and margo's playwrighter  then bette davis in the performance of a lifetime. the movie is about 90% dialogue  much like a play.  the words are so crisp and sharp  you never sway or lose interest.  these characters are just too interesting.  bette davis has a cavalcade of unforgettable dialogue. ""fasten your seatbelts.  its going to be a bumpy night!""  this is the one everyone remembers  but i would be remiss to get into any others.the picture runs well over 2 hours  but it doesn't seem like enough. mankiewicz could've held a seminar of screenwriting by showing this.  george sanders is the only actor of the roster to bring home an academy award  and rumor has it davis and baxter  who was just 27 at the time  were feuding during much of the shoot and lusted the oscar.  time has been very good to the film as well.  1950 was a wonderful year for movies and all about eve's artistic equal that year was the equally well-written sunset boulevard  which took us behind the scenes of a tainted hollywood.  eve takes on theatre and treats hollywood like an afterthought.  there are many references to the film industry  usually involving the scenes with margo channing's boyfriend  who is attempting to make a career on the silver screen.the movie is highly unpredictable  especially the last scenes which tie the ideas of the story up.  there is an eve everywhere and each character gets what he or she deserves. fasten the belts and listen up.  this is screenwriting at its finest."
"having had his day as an idolized star and romantic leading man  it was now time for bogart to get down to the serious business of acting for eighteen years it had usually been bogart playing bogart in various shadings now that bogart was gone and in his place was an older and far less romantic figure  one who found new challenges and was able to meet most of them successfully this new phase of his continued growth began with a story of three men in search of gold although ""the treasure of the sierra madre"" is indisputably one of bogart's best films  it was co-star walter huston who won an academy award as did the movie's director and scenarist  john huston based on a novel by the mysterious b. traven  the film told a riveting tale which explored the degenerative effects of encroaching greed  distrust  and hatred on three prospectors who team up to search for gold in mexico bogart's fred c. dobbs was an amazingly complex creation whose slow disintegration into paranoia was brilliant1y managed on camera he is a born loser with no potential for change in sight suspicious  unfeeling  savage  and easily corruptible  he seems clearly destined for a tragic fate almost from our first meeting with him tim holt was also excellent as bob curtin  a man who  like bogart  is tempted but whose conscience will not permit him to exercise his baser desires. (he could have let bogart die in a cave-in  but saved him instead.) young  impressionable  and unprepared  he has never seen the likes of a fred c. dobbs and he finds himself overwhelmed and uncertain as to how he will cope with dobbs's rage and greed however  it is the director's father  walter huston  who literally stole the picture from both bogart and holt as he played howard  a wise old toothless codger who knew all along what would happen and took it all in stride  kicking up his heels and having a marvelous time life can't surprise him any more he's already had successes and failures enough for one lifetime like a faithful dog  he's along for the thrill of the hunt  and should there be another pot of gold at the end of this rainbow  well  that's just a bonus it is mainly the interaction of these three men from their first meeting and uneasy partnership through their final confrontation that made ""the treasure of the sierra madre"" one of warner brothers' triumphs of the forties"
the only thing i have to add to the many well-written reviews here is this: it's astounding that bogart wasn't nominated in the academy awards' best actor category. sure  he had his share of nods in other years  but his portrayal of the complex dobbs is unique. watch this classic-for many reasons-and see if bogie's performance isn't oscar-worthy.
"husband and wife carole lombard (maria) and jack benny (joseph) are the leading lights in a polish theatre company during the outbreak of world war 2. they are currently performing ""hamlet"" and soldier robert stack (sobinski)  who is obsessed with lombard and attends all her performances  is there in the audience on every occasion. lombard and stack arrange meetings with a pre-determined code. when benny gives his ""to be or not to be"" soliloquy  that is stack's cue to get up and leave and go backstage  much to benny's outrage at someone getting up and leaving during his finest moment! when traitor stanley ridges (professor siletsky) passes through poland on his way to deliver a list of names of polish resistance members to hitler  the actors jump into action to prevent him reaching germany with the list. can they get away with their daring charades? this film is funnier than i expected and had me laughing out loud on a few occasions. jack benny is excellent in the lead role and the whole cast are on form. there are loads of humorous scenes and the film has a great ending to round things off. it's a shame that they cut carole lombard's line about what could possibly happen in a plane from the film. this would have given extra poignancy to the film given that she died in a plane crash after making this film. i think the line should have remained in there.basically  a gang of actors come good and defeat the nazis through various deceptions. it's lightweight entertainment that really does entertain."
"comedies rarely stand the test of time - this one does: one of the funniest films i have ever seen.when i was 16 (20 years ago  sigh...)  this was re-released for a short time in a local art-house cinema  and my father insisted i go watching it with a friend. well  teenagers don't normally line up to see 50 year old black and white comedies  but - man  was i glad i did!this is a pitch black comedy that feels as fresh today as it must have then; in fact  this must have been kind of a shock in 1942. there are no cheesy clean characters or cringe-worthy lines: this is a firework of fast  witty dialogue with an edge and the sexiest  cleverest (and most morally ambiguous) female protagonist i have ever seen in a film before the ""new hollywod"" era.even the structure and the way the story evolves are very modern; there are flashbacks and twists and turns that might be very common in contemporary films but must have seemed almost ""avant-garde"" at the time.the biggest fun  of course  is how lubitsch takes the pi** out of hitler's blind  fanatic followers. i don't believe the nazis have ever been mocked better than in this comedy masterpiece (and i only hope old adolf has seen it  too). mel brooks' remake is not bad  but the original is simply killer. see it  and then see it again (and again).priceless. 10 out of 10favorite films: http://www.imdb.com/list/mkjokvqlsbs/lesser-known masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/favorite low-budget and b-movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/favorite tv-shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/"
"charles chaplin's ""the gold rush"" is arguably his finest film. he stars as a wimpy prospector who decides to go to the klondike in the hopes of striking it rich. what he does not realize is that he may find love (in the form of georgia hale) instead of money. in the end that may be all right with him. ""the gold rush"" shows everything that made charles chaplin the great performer  writer and director he was. quite possibly the finest cinematic icon of the 20th century  chaplin showed humanity  love and an undying want to entertain all audiences throughout his stellar cinematic career. the movie is exceptional in every way. although i am not as well-versed with movies from the 1920s as i am with the decades following it  i would still probably call ""the gold rush"" the finest film of that 10-year period. oh how the cinema misses charles chaplin today. 5 stars out of 5."
"the gold rush is one of chaplin's best films  as well as one of his most famous. it has been said that it is the film that he most wanted to be remembered by  and it's not hard to see why. chaplin plays the part of the lone prospector  a young miner during the gold rush. after getting caught in a storm  he hurries to the only shelter that he can find  a wood cabin in the middle of the storm. it turns out that it is already inhabited  and by a tough criminal named black larson  no less  and the scene in which charlie and big jim  another prospector  insist to black larson that they are going to stay is one of the countless memorable scenes in the film.
charlie and big jim are left alone and without food when larson goes off to face the storm looking for food (having drawn the lowest card in another amusing scene)  and the scenes in the cabin are some of the best in the entire film. there is  of course  the boot eating scene  memorable not only because of its cleverness and effectiveness  but also because while making the film  chaplin ate so much boot (which was made out of licorice) before he was satisfied with the take that he had to be taken to the hospital to have his stomach pumped. another thing that was really well done was the special effects. i am still amazed every time i watch the film at how realistic it looks when there is a long shot from outside showing charlie hanging from the door of the cabin  which is balanced precariously on the edge of a cliff. also notice the fast paced and very effective music during this scene  the same song that is played in the best scene of the 1996 film shine  with geoffrey rush. there is also a very noteworthy love element of the gold rush  a part of the story that chaplin generally has much success with in his films. charlie's amorous interests in georgia  a dance hall girl  leads to the scene where he performs the famous dance of the dinner rolls  probably the most famous scene in the film  which was also performed very well by johnny depp in benny & joon. charlie's relationship with georgia is also the thing that leads to his presentation of his sympathy for the lower classes  when he meets her on the ship after having become a multi-millionaire. chaplin's full length films are inherently more famous than his earlier short comedies  and the gold rush is one of the best of his full length features. a must see for any chaplin fan  but the gold rush is also a film that anyone who is interested in quality comedy should watch."
sherlock  jr. arguably exceeds the general as buster keaton's greatest achievement -- it is certainly more magical in its use of extraordinary special effects and unconventionally humorous situations.  movies about movies are a dime a dozen  but rather difficult to do well.  keaton's brilliant structuring of the story -- a fantastic treat for audiences when his pathetic projectionist becomes the genius detective through a literal entering of the movie screen -- has been imitated dozens of times  but i always come back to this unsurpassable rendering.  watching keaton play the scene where he studies how to go about kissing his best girl by peeking at a movie version of the same event always reduces me to simultaneous jags of tears and laughter.
"it's almost impossible to describe the astounding creativity of ""sherlock  jr"".  even for buster keaton  this is a tremendous display of comedic and fantasy material.  what's so remarkable is not so much any particularly hilarious gag or gags  as the never-ending stream of amazing and entertaining sights - coming faster and faster as the film proceeds - that seem so off-hand and effortlessly inventive  but that must have involved many hours of painstaking work to perfect.  the film vs. reality theme is also highly suggestive  and makes this great movie one of the most completely satisfying efforts by keaton or anyone else.the film opens slowly and allows the pace to build gradually.  buster operates the movie projector at a theater  while trying to study on his own to be a detective.  he is involved in a real-life mystery that involves his girlfriend's family  and which turns out badly for him.  he retreats into the fantasy world of a picture showing at his theater  and from then on you just have to see it to appreciate it.  the creative comedy  the technical skill  and the subtly expressed themes are all remarkable.this is a great experience not to be missed."
stunning cinematography. slowly evolving plot. i expected more from the ratings. struggled to finish it.
the ending of this film left me in tears  but the good kind where you simply emote from the pleasure of seeing a work of art.i had to figure out how to log back into my imdb account  just to express my humble opinion for a moment.i had to give it a 10/10 because it filled me with the emotion described above -- the entire movie was pure  honest art. the acting was excellent  as well as the entire direction of the film  visually and otherwise.the film accomplished what it set out to do --share a love story worth remembering. in this case  a special romance that was expressed in the most succinct and captivating way.what may have cost this movie a star for others (looking at you  9/10 people)  i do not know. i just know that special feeling only certain movies give me after the first watch and this one had it.
makoto shinkai shadowed this movie so hard it seems that koe no katachi lost its capacity to shine; he did a good job and all  but this is just one step above on every aspect. doing an adaptation of another amazing work  inserting several manga inside a single movie of that quality is really hard  and only a few people did that throught history. naoko yamada is still the messiah anime needs but not the one weebs want. she's jesus and batman combined  and liz and the blue bird will probably suffer of the same thing.
"to begin with  a friend of mine recommended me this movie. at first  i was skeptical about it because personally  i'm not a big fan of anime type of movies but i decided to give it a go.the movie is beautiful to look at. the movie is hand-drawn  and the outdoor settings and backdrops are breathtaking.a silent voice is a film that had me hating throughout the first act  realizing i was wrong throughout the second act  and on the verge of tears throughout the third act  due to how well this movie does a complete 180. the story is powerful enough to have many in tears in the final sequences. therefore  for me  ""a silent voice"" is a true piece of art.this movie is definitely worth the time and the awards."
haven't seen a perfect suspense thriller like this in the longest time. a must watch. perfecto!!
i wont explain anything  it would be a waste of time. my only review is this: watch this movie right now!!!!!!
i saw this tonight at london film festival and park chan wook was there  to answer q&a. a very special moment to me.i would advise anyone new to park chan-wook's filmography to first explore his vampire flick 'thirst' which has a similar style. 'oldboy' is a cult classic  but more of an opium-filled  octopus eating thrill-ride  which this film is not  so be advised. i also think having some knowledge of japanese rule in korea is essential for understanding this film  or it will be above your head. do some surface-level research on japanese annexation of korea and specifically the infamous 'comfort women'.completed that? ok now you're ready for this journey.now let's focus on the best part. the villain. this is the best villain in recent memory. seriously as far back as hannibal lecter. uncle kouzuki  is more creepy than burton's penguin. compulsory viewing. i cannot mention anymore out of fear for spoiling the intricate plot. highly recommended.
this is hands down the most perfect film i have seen so far this year. i gave a score of 5/5 to movies like the revenant  spotlight and the songs we sang. but even with these excellent films i can always find a spot that doesn't quite sit right with me. with the handmaiden  it is perfect; every frame handcrafted to perfection. even with 4min of explicit sex taken away by my country's dumb censors  this is still perfect every way i see it. auteur park chan-wook's the handmaiden is a superb exercise in form  structure and tone. with the latter  park (oldboy & joint security area) has achieved something extraordinary. if any scene were to linger a few seconds longer or he had decided to focus on a certain issue  the film would have veered off to a different territory. as it is  and with all the major characters' kooky off-kilter portrayals  i can't pinpoint whether i was watching something real or abstract. i was also kept in awe by the intricate and resplendent set- design which suggests something dark and gothic is working the undercurrents. there are of course some serious girl on girl action but that never encroaches into the spine of the story. adapting sarah waters' fingersmith  a victorian tale awash with all manner of dickensian motifs  park spins an engrossing tale that ebbs and flows with a hitchcockian suspense; it withholds as much as it discloses; it is an erotic tale that beats with raw fervour. it is at once a love story but also a menagerie showcasing human beings in their vilest forms. park's finger hovers over all the buttons  teasing us gleefully but it is with the ultimate restraint that he never descends down to the usual tropes. the story is divided into three chapters; each told from a different character's perspective. the structure is rashomon-esque but park puts his own stamp on it. the film may be nearly 2.5 hours but i hardly moved in my seat; my senses kept spellbound as each twist hits me hard. when it ended i couldn't believe 2.5 hours have whizzed by. the plot is pulsating and it never lets up. there is even an octopus in it! this is definitely the most perfect film i have seen this year. you may not agree with me but for me this is cinema of the masterclass level. it's sexy time!
"the final outing of wolverine by hugh jackman is one unforgettable ride and one of the best comic-book movies in recent memory. directed by james mangold-who was also at the helm of ""the wolverine"" (2013)- logan creates a character-driven  violent and emotional film  which benefits from its rated-r rating. the acting  action and story of logan are one-of-a-kinds in the superhero genre  as the cast  headed by hugh jackman  patrick stewart and newly- introduced dafne keen  play their characters to the fullest. it is unlike any other x-men film  definitely the best in the series and deserves the praise it's getting.when i saw the first trailer drop  headlined by johnny cash's ""hurt""  i instantly knew we would be getting something different from everything else that has dropped since the first x-men film in 2000. the brutality and intensity of the characters pay off in this almost two-and-a- half hour that redefines the superhero genre  and i hope pays dividends for future movies to come. the introduction of x-23 was a big win as well. she is played by dafne keen  and though doesn't say much  plays her role very well. her connection with both hugh and patrick creates a family-orientated environment that makes the movie a whole lot better  especially seen in certain scenes.lastly  as much as i want the character of wolverine to continue being played on the big screen  it would be better for everyone if they didn't re-cast the role  as no-one would be able to play the role much like the legendary hugh jackman. overall  mangold and the cast  create a masterfully orchestrated film that will be remembered for years to come. not only is it a great film  but it is the last time we will be able to appreciate and witness hugh jackman and patrick stewart in the x-men universe."
no words can explain the epicness & greatness of this movie.
"it's hard to get revenge on a bad movie. i am partially consoled considering i snuck into this theater rather than paying for a ticket. still  this subversion robbed me of the cathartic argument over my refund with some hapless manager. room stole two hours of my life  and the only way i am going to get value from that experience is to get the last word. room has an extremely fertile premise. an unnamed woman (brie larson) has been kidnapped and imprisoned in a shed for seven years  five of which she has spent raising her son jack (jacob tremblay). i am unaware how the book navigated this premise  but author and screenwriter emma donoghue had a bottomless potential of directions and selected none. the writing is too shallow to be a thought experiment on trauma or a character study. the narrative is too muddled by loose ends to be a simple ""feel good"" movie. cult classic the room had a similar degree of cohesion yeah okay no it didn't. poor contractually obligated jokes aside  room is simply aimless. this child grows up in a 10x10 room surrounded by sexual abuse his entire life and his lone complications are a paleness  shyness  and poor grammar. i have met children with comparable behavior from normal households. children might be plastic  but no one is going to manage a full swift recovery from being born into this environment. the mother character is better explored  but barely. the strength of this woman while kidnapped is unbelievable  but interesting questions are raised after the escape. her relationship with her parents  her friends  and dealing with new realties are all introduced and either dropped or solved off screen. this is a device derived from the book where everything is seen through jack's perspective. but post-escape jack is just cute and boring  not worth following. his narration of events is insufferable. the conclusion of room is sickening. the film has the audacity to propose that mother and son will be able to leave this experience behind in the closing moments. this claim is beyond ignorant and well into insulting.for the sake of critical fairness i will mention all the two and a half things i enjoyed. the escape sequence is genuinely thrilling. putting a child in peril is often a cheap way to manipulate the audience. it worked here  so credit is due. second  the cinematography in the room itself was surprising. i think most films would have tried for a more claustrophobic. instead  the dimensions are simply defined and unjudged. the abrupt camera pans while jack is running from wall to wall brilliantly reflects the mindset of these trapped characters. this place is simultaneously small and their entire world; traversing the room is trivial  but also the greatest possible distance. the one victory achieved by the closing scene is the brief moment perfect perspective when the room is seen from the outside. finally  the acting was serviceable. it is hard to completely differentiate the awful roles from performances  but the film did dodge some melodrama. the oscars successfully suckered me into watching room. i would like to just chuck this movie atop a pile of other examples where the illustrious academy failed  but i am apparently in the minority. there are some aspects of quality filmmaking here  but there is no prize for best drama for housewives. room took a premise ripe with potential and failed to nurture it with a drop of ingenuity or realism. i was disappointed  and i refuse to believe i am the only one."
"spoiler: at the 2015 toronto international film festival the film ""room"" won the people's choice award today. it tells a story of a young woman and her five year old son who have been held in captivity in a confined and windowless living space for six years. brie larson stars as ma and her son named jack is played by jacob tremblay who is so believable that you will feel empathetic towards their captivity but relief as to how ma convinces jack that their little world is real and is wonderful. as jack grows he starts to ask questions about their isolated lifestyle and we the audience anticipate that ma must try and escape with young jack but how?the story draws similarities to the actual events that were jaycee lee dugard's true life story which occurred on june 10  1991  in south lake tahoe  california. dugard was 11 years old at the time she was abducted from a street while she was walking from home to a school bus stop and she was held captive for the next 18 years in a concealed back yard in a make shift shed. there is also some resemblance to the kidnapping of amanda berry who had a child fathered by her kidnapper ariel castro. this film was titled cleveland abduction and it was released in 2015. it tells the true story of three girls who were held captive for over 10 years by ariel castro in his home with no one aware how close the girls were to their own homes and families.the film room focuses more on jack and ma's awkward adjustment to life outside of their room which was their entire world for the past six years. there is a strong supporting cast including performances such as joan allen's role as jack's loving grandma and the ever convincing all-star william h macy as a resistant grandpa who is having difficulty accepting that his daughter is raising her rapist's son. there are some scenes that are so heartwarming that it will be difficult not to find yourself becoming emotionally involved. in one particular very touching and loving scene  jack asks his grandma to cut his long hair so that the strength that he thinks that his shoulder length hair possesses can be transferred over to his sick ma so she can return home from the hospital. jack who understandably is initially withdrawn from anyone other than his ma simply tells his grandma after she washes and cuts his hair that he loves her. this loving scene between jack and his grandma will stay with me forever. jack and ma's is a story of isolation  fear  hopelessness versus hope and most importantly a film about redemption and the family bond. room is deserving of an oscar nomination for best picture and nominations in a few other categories as well such as best actress  best actor and best director. i give the film a 9.5 out of 10 rating. this film is terrific!!"
hilarious and very  very black comedy consisting of six episodes about people who get driven to the edge of reason (and a little beyond). the acting and writing in this gem from argentina are superb  and the beautifully photographed segments keep you thrilled and unable to guess just what crazy turn they will take next. a wonderful joy of a film for film lovers with a rather twisted sense of humor. 8 stars out of 10.in case you're interested in more underrated film gems  here's some of my favorites:imdb.com/list/ls070242495
"watched last night at the theater with my girlfriend.it's a compilations of 6 tales  but they don't have the same type of lenght  humor or darkness. each one is unique.1) airplane tale: fantastic  hilarating and surrealistic story to open the series.2) coffee shop tale: shorter  but dark and makes you wonder what's ""freedom"" for some people.3) road tale: excellent. a really lot of violence and a little bit of humor makes this one of the best tales in the movie.4) human limit tale: a man that's having a couple of really bad days explode when he runs out of patiente. great acting.5) accident tale: 90% darkness. and the fact that could be a very possible story makes it even darker. shocking finale.6) wedding tale: almost impossible to qualify. hilarious for the most part  but at the end  it will make you wonder to whom you are spending your whole life with.seeing this compilation in a theater for the price of one  its a damn good deal if you ask me.go watch it."
"i am probably in a minority when i say that i didn't enjoy this movie  i wanted to like it  the idea seemed sound and the cast is a cavalcade of top notch actors.i am still trying to work out what it was that made me dislike the film  maybe it was the simple fact that there was no plot to speak of  a tenuous vehicle to give the actors a chance to show their stuff. admittedly the sets were grand (as the name implies)  the production company went all out to create this world; and the acting was excellent but there is a problem here too.the problem i found with the acting was that each member the ensemble cast didn't get a fair crack of the whip when it came to showing their stuff. most of the actors/characters got just a few minutes of time (apart from the leads of course)  i wanted more interplay between these actors  surely there was time for that rather than long rambling scenes of inane dialogue.when the film ended i was left with a feeling of ""so what""  i didn't care about the outcome of any of the characters. i am sure that some people will enjoy this but i didn't."
my heart is still rolling from the escape to 30's europe this afternoon  and without jet lag. this movie is an inspiration  a dream  a walk through a painting and a study of humanity. ralph fiennes﻿ is a phenomenon as m. gustave. his interactions with every cast member and especially newcomer tony revolori are fantastic. the later holds his own weight beyond belief and the entire film is an amazing adventure with james bond style chases  a large murder mystery  the best placed cussing and of course the sensational cinematography. the sets  models  angles and even the most nondescript characters come to life each on their own and together as a symphony of beauty. it's freaking brilliant; the grand budapest hotel.
"i have always been a huge admirer of david fincher. he is undoubtedly one of the most consistent and masterful storytellers in modern cinema. i also think when it comes to dark  disturbing thrillers  there is very few who can match the directorial skills of fincher. like many of his previous films  gone girl is a very long film  but in a true fincher-esque fashion  it is as engaging as possible without any scope for the viewer to feel bored. the pacing is perfect. the scenes have a dreamy style to it  which brings the dilemma of ""whether this is a true account of things or has this been made up by the narrator."" the theme of the film is the fact that humans at the basic level are all actors and pretenders. very seldom do we decide to be our real selves. generally all of us put on a mask to make ourselves look good in front of the general public and also to pretend to be the person that our nearest and dearest want us to be. gillian flynn's screenplay based on her own novel is brilliant and it is also a damning indictment of how media can shape and mould mass perception and it is also a cynical account of the institution of marriage.ben affleck is good  tyler perry is good  but this movie from an acting perspective belongs to rosamund pike. she owns every scene that she is in and delivers an oscar-worthy performance.fincher has once again has made a fantastic film. the last 30 minutes might not be completely logical  but it is still symbolic. if you are about to get married stay away from gone girl."
"amy and nick dunne are young  stylish and charming. the immaculate dream couple? it seems so  at least on the face of it. but infidelity and financial troubles let the glamorous façade crumble. one morning  amy disappears without a trace  and nick becomes suspect. did he kill his wife? the media depict him as an uncaring husband  and he's trying desperately to correct that image. but what if he really is the murderer everyone believes him to be?""gone girl""  based on the gillian flynn novel of the same name  is a masterful thriller  a sharp-sighted media satire and a cynical analysis of modern marriage. flynn herself wrote the screenplay for the movie adaptation  and david fincher turns the already disturbing story into something even darker. ""gone girl"" is a perfect fit for fincher  as it is concerned with two of his favorite themes: gender issues and modern media. the main topic here is how the media are shaping our own identities. nick dunne has to adapt to the expectations of the public in order to survive. as his lawyer tanner bolt puts it: ""this case is about what people think of you.""amy and nick both just play a character. they pretend to be a perfect couple. the movie suggests that pretending and being are not as far apart as we tend to think. when everyone plays along  the shallow masks are going to work. the much-maligned ending underlines this insight perfidiously. it's the point where ""gone girl"" becomes a pitch-black social satire. the last act isn't a thriller anymore  it's a grotesque caricature of modern relationships. i've never seen anything like it  and i can't praise fincher enough for the risk he took with the last half an hour of this movie. ben affleck is great as the insipid husband nick. you love to hate him. rosamund pike is simply mind-blowing. you'll also see neil patrick harris and tyler perry in unusual roles. my personal favorite is carrie coon as nick's caring yet foul-mouthed sister margo. she's the heart of this movie  because unlike everyone else  she genuinely speaks her mind. kim dickens as the clever detective rhonda boney is pretty approachable  too.""gone girl"" might be fincher's most splendid masterpiece yet. this movie is so unsettling and cynical  it feels like it was directed by the love child of alfred hitchcock and lars von trier. if that's not awesome  i don't know what is."
"for well over a year now i have been waiting with baited breath to see this movie. i have been a fan of desmond doss from a child. having the privilege of the movie being filmed in my neck of the woods  and even getting to watch some of the scenes being filmed and meeting mel in the process (ever so briefly)  escalated my enthusiasm. when you are that pumped and euphoric  you are usually deflated when the moment finally comes but not this time.although there were a few aspects of the story that were not as accurate as i would have liked  i realize poetic licence is necessary in some ways to give the real essence of the story. and truth can be so much harder to believe then fiction sometimes. mel managed to portray the man doss so very well. some people are worried this is a religious propaganda/anti-gun movie and i assure you that is not the message of it at all. however there is no getting past the truth of who he was and it is the reason the story is so powerful. he was a man with an unmovable moral compass and it doesn't matter if you don't point yours in the same direction  you can't help but respect him for his courage  bravery  and unwavering faith. the movie starts laying the background of the man that will be the hero of hacksaw ridge. it is both witty and endearing. andrew garfield nails the roll as the gentle scarecrow of a man. he is a bit gawky and yet charming. his accent is true to the real desmond  awkward though it is at times. he really draws you into the character and shows you what a fighter he was  non-violent but a fighter just the same. it is well explained what personal experiences have lead him to his discussion to not touch a gun.hugo weaving masterfully plays desmond's alcoholic dad  battling with his demons from wwi  and rachel griffiths plays his devoted christian mother trying to hold them all together. teresa palmer plays dorothy  a nurse that captures desmond's heart. sometimes cheesy  but then again in reality it would have been  and it is very amusing to watch. teresa's dorothy is a beautiful and charming addition to the movie.vince vaughn plays the roll of drill sergeant howell. he adds humour with his name calling  and humiliation of the soldiers  but is a very genuine - just a guy trying to win a war and keep his men alive in the process - kind of guy. luke bracey is a fantastic addition to the cast as private smitty  the more traditional war story soldier.true to his reputation mel does not hold back with the battle scenes. the devastation is already extensive and the ground strewn with bits of bodies by the time the 77th arrives. the shattering reality of war is dizzying and full of impact  moving so quickly you can barely identify the characters in a whirlwind of panic  pain and death. but amidst the chaos  desmond doss's character is revealed to everyone and even his harshest critics realize how wrong they were about him. watching the story change from having the battalion hate him so much that they try to have him imprisoned  to refusing to go on the battlefield without him  is so moving and inspiring it leaves ""it's a wonderful life"" in the carnage on the hill  getting eaten by maggots along with the dead soldiers desmond sifts through looking for ""one more"" soul to save."
another wwii movie but instead of d-day and the battle of dunkirk  it's the battle of okinawa in japan. which means  new branch of military and new settings. usually i want war movies to focus on the historical accuracies and action rather than characters  but this movie changed my opinion. it tells the story of desmond doss and his life and how he joined the army  that was very interesting and well-acted. the beginning explained our main character and introduced all the others  who are also a good addition. but the rest of the movie is awesome. the battle scene is engaging  heart-wrenching  and epic. it is very gruesome  some may not like that  but that's how it actually happened - when you get hit with a bullet  there's going to be blood. the fight portrayed desmond's goal and his heart to save others  which you have to respect. not only does this movie provide adrenaline  but also a learning experience.
i have no clue why people hail this as a comeback of sorts for pixar. it left me empty and appalled at its simplicity while also creating a sense of dread for what pixar would do in the future.
"oh my god. this has to be the most misunderstood pixar film ever created.
i never realized how much hate this movie had gotten until now  but  reading through the reviews  it just isn't justified.
all of these are parents complaining about it being too intense for young children  but  this film isn't for them. i found that it reached out to a completely new audience  one that pixar hasn't really touched upon recently  and that is pre-teens and teenagers that suffer from depression.
i am now 14 years old  and this film came out at just the right time for me  when things were taking a turn for the worst. i was going through depression and suicidal thoughts for reasons that i don't want to talk about  around the time in which this film was released. i hadn't seen a disney film in quite a long time  and my little sister really wanted to see this one.
looking at all the generally positive feedback  i decided to go see it with her.
the opening sequence was possibly one of the best pixar had done since wall-e. it was beautiful and cinematic  and just adorable. riley had some pretty gorgeous facial expressions and detailing for an animation standpoint.
as the film moved on  i started to realize how well this film related to my life  and how well riley related to me as a character. pixar was very subtle with it  but  managed to develop riley's character so well  with her barely being on screen.
the characters themselves were shockingly complex  especially sadness and joy. (joy has a brilliant character design  with blue eyes and blue hair which we'll get to later.)
the main plot basically revolves around a pre-teen going into a state of depression after moving to her new home  away from her friends  her hockey team.
depression  in my experience  isnt what it says it is. to me  it is a complete lack of any feeling whatsoever. when joy and sadness basically lose control of riley for awhile  this perfectly captured the ""what is going on inside their head"" meaning at the beginning of the film. joy and sadness are the two most important emotions  and riley didnt have them anymore. a complete lack of emotion  a state of depression.
the rest of the film after that was enjoyable  and a certain character whom i was almost sure going to be a twist villain after that monstrosity that was 'frozen'  turned out to be my personal favorite character in the film. everyone's had some sort of imaginative personality growing up. i had one.
it helped me cope with stress  i talked to it when i was mad about something  and whenever no one seemed to want to talk to me for whatever the reason  she was always there. that's why bing bong's death was just so hard to watch  because of how painfully true it is. i guarantee that 99% of the people on earth have completely forgotten about their imaginative friends growing up. the thing is  he didnt die  he was completely forgotten. when you think about it  it seems so much worse than dying. after that  joy seems to have forgotten about him as well. he isnt mentioned ever again in the movie  but  i'm kinda okay with that. if the movie forgets about him  the audience does as well  which creates an illusion.
now  let's talk about the ending.
when riley returns home to her worried parents  she seems emotionless. then i realized something  a slow realization that happened throughout the final scene in the film.
true happiness cannot exist without sadness.
this realization is depicted in one of the most brilliant forms ever  mixed emotions. as riley is growing up and maturing  mixed emotions become apart of her and her core memories. this symbolizes maturity and complexity as you grow up.
this film got me to open up to my parents about my depression and anxiety  and i feel like i have matured just like riley did in the film. pixar did a brilliant job as depicting our emotions  personalities  and maturity. i love this film so much  and it changed my life."
once again hollywood waves its sanctimonious wand over history with this glossy movie about slavery in the united states. like a self-righteous teetotaler telling off an alcoholic  it is a sentimental  holier-than-thou piece that challenges you to criticize it or 'you're a racist too'. following in the footsteps of django it uses the excuse of history and a worthy theme to justify gratuitous scenes of violence. the film begins in the home of the central character  solomon northop  a free black man  who lives a genteel life with his family in new york. the director is clearly eager to get to the gory bits though  and within the first ten minutes solomon has been kidnapped  enslaved  and the audience is cringing under a close up of his contorted face during a twenty minute whipping scene; the first of many to come. the film continues in this vein  as we follow solomon's journey through an array of increasingly evil slave-owners. there is a segregation of personality in the film  with most of the black characters being good and moral and the white ones evil. surely it is as patronizing and insulting to assume personality is dependent on colour as it is politically correct. at least the same cannot be said of gender  the white women are as evil as their male counterparts. however no film about slavery is complete without our token good white guy  and brad pitts rises to the occasion  strolling in bearded and ready to play  once again  the hero.one does wonder why solomon doesn't send a letter under his 'mistress'name on one of his frequent forays to the shop. (of course  his one attempt to run away is thwarted when after two steps he stumbles on a lynching scene). perhaps the point the director is trying to make is that solomon is too broken and scared to do this. he is too proud  however  to pick the cotton quota demanded by the sadistic slave-owner. a necessary contradiction perhaps  as this allows more whipping scenes as he is punished daily.or why  instead of trying and failing to write a letter with a blunt bamboo stick and watery juice  he doesn't simply use the candle end and stain the paper instead. but it is not a film for the details. nor the historical overview.it is two hours of increasing brutality  culminating with a horrendous scene where one girl is whipped until her flesh is exposed. instead of taking one of the many examples of modern day slavery however  which could leave people feeling guilty at inaction  it is set far enough in the past that it allows the audience to do their cinema time  and leave feeling as worthy and sanctimonious as the director.
"12 years a slave tells the true story of solomon northup  an educated and free black man living in new york during the 1840's who gets abducted  shipped to the south  and sold into slavery. it is a film that stimulates at both an emotional level and an intellectual one. chiwetel ejiofor plays solomon northup. he's been a ""that guy"" actor for sometime – film-goers may know his face but not his name. after this film his name will be known. he gives  quite simply  the best performance from a leading actor since daniel day lewis in there will be blood. because of his character's position as a slave he is usually unable to speak his mind unless he is prepared to be beaten. as a result ejiofor is forced to utilize body language and his eyes  which become enormous pools of emotion to express himself to the audience. he's forced to endure terrible things  but he always maintains a certain dignity and nobility that makes his plight even more affecting. it's a performance of incredible subtlety that may leave you speechless and in complete awe.micheal fassbender gives the best performance of his already extremely impressive career  even besting his previous high marks from the films shame and hunger (both directed by steve mcqueen  who also directed 12 years a slave). he plays edwynn epps  a vicious and demonic slaver and perhaps the most loathsome and disgusting character ever put on screen. if alive today  he'd likely be a drunk with severe anger management issues. by turns pathetic and terrifying  he embodies the ultimate nightmare of a deeply flawed man given absolute power over other human beings  and through that absolute power finds only madness  which drives him to deeper cruelty. he's always a menacing and malignant presence even when not on screen  as his slaves must always be aware and prepared for his seemingly random bouts of sadism. other actors give excellent performances as well. paul giamatti  paul dano  benedict cumberbatch  sarah paulson  alfre woodard are all great in relatively small roles. but in this film of titans it's the one you've probably never heard of who perhaps stands above them all. in her first role in a feature film  lupita nyong'o  playing the pretty young slave patsey - the object of edwynn epps demented and horrifying affections and the emotional epicenter of the entire picture  gives one of the most devastating performances i have ever seen. a portrait of unbearable sadness  her character is a mirror image of solomon. while solomon is a man who refuses to break and give up the dignity which he's known since birth  she is one who has long since been broken  and who never knew dignity in the first place. her life is a living hell  forced to endure the ""love"" of edwyn epps and the brutal jealousy of his wife  she's trapped in a terrible triangle that she can't escape. despite that  she retains a level of innocence that only heightens the tragedy of her character. it actually gets to the point where simply looking at this character might be enough to bring you to tears. it's a shattering performance.starting his career as a video artist before making full length films  steve mcqueen has an uncanny eye for imagery and contrast. he's also a very patient film maker  utilizing long  steady single shots to emphasize various things. in his prior films this has felt like a purely stylistic choice  here  it's a choice aimed directly at our heart. when the events on screen become their most horrifying and ugly is when his camera becomes the most unflinching. at times feeling perhaps like we're seeing out of the solemn eyes of the ghost of some murdered slave  watching in sorrow and rage. this is both mcqueen's most accessible and artistically searing film yet. there are also moments of stunning natural beauty that would make terrence malick proud. alone  these shots would inspire wonder  but in the context of this film they make us feel more forlorn  as if the ugliness of man is encroaching on the natural beauty of the world.perhaps the most noteworthy thing about 12 years a slave is the way that it portrays slavery itself. instead of taking the easy way out and limiting his exploration of the topic solely to the slaves  steve mcqueen increases the scope and we see how it affects those who profited by it. take benedict cumberbatch's character. a seemingly decent and caring man who treats his slaves with some semblance of respect and kindness. he comes off as a relatively good man who is trapped within the powerful confines of the institution of slavery. in 12 years a slave  slavery is shown as a horrifying and destructive social construct that drains the humanity from everyone it touches  turning good men into moral quandaries  turning flawed men into monsters  and turning an entire race of people into livestock and tools. to watch 12 years a slave is to be confronted with the grim reality of slavery in a way that's never been done before. to say this is the best film ever made about slavery feels trivial  as slavery is a subject in film that has been shown with naive romanticism from films like gone with the wind or silly exploitation from something like django unchained. both of which serve to make the topic digestible. to watch 12 years a slave is to experience a level of despair and misery that can become overwhelming. it's a film of such ugliness  such blunt emotional trauma  that it may haunt you for hours if not days after seeing it. so why should you watch a film that could leave you reeling and devastated? because  it's also one of the greatest cinematic achievements of our time."
i like the film rush as it's about two formula 1 drivers and they are called niki lauda and james hunt who were both fighting for the world championship in 1976.the best part of the film that i like is when niki lauda has a fiery crash at the nürburgring in germany as it was raining at the time of his crash and he had to be taken to hospital for his injuries to his face as it was upsetting to watch when he was get surgery done to his face.i think that this film is better than the senna film because it's more realistic and upsetting.
just come out the cinema in york from watching rush! oh my god! one of the most intense films i have watched in a very long time with gripping performances from hemsworth and brühl! an extremely clever script from peter morgan in which he doesn't pick sides  but instead allows the audience to view these characters in their own light.i am a huge fan of f1 so when viewing a film relating to that sport it would be questionable that there are some anachronisms or minor problems. but no! there was not a single fault with this film  it is the most realistic sports film i have viewed! a film that portrays the rivalry between the british and austrian world champions and the fateful crash. with some powerful dialogue from lauda and hunt.even if you aren't a fan of f1  the intense action and no-holds adrenaline should keep you entertained from start to finish. with a great sway of emotions from melancholy to ecstatic! this film deserves the acclaimed reviews it has been receiving.
"i used to race cars  still spend a bit of time on the track  so i know this story 
even met some of the actual people involved here (i'm old)  and i wanted to really like the movie more than i did. of course the car porn was fantastic  the casual way in which iconic multi-million dollar cars were placed around the set and even some of the scenes showing the gt40 moving around the airport tarmac were very good. for the latter  they captured speed well here  which is very difficult. so  kudos. but the actual danger involved  although shown to some extent  was not given the attention really needed. i understand the dramatic demands for a movie  but i would think emphasizing the danger would only help. just to be clear  there were two deaths in a five month period  miles and macdonald  although deaths and massive injuries were very common then  these deaths actually had an effect on the racing community. also  to be clear  the ford effort was massive  they simply hired the very best in the us to get the gt40 developed. it really was a huge disparity between ford and any other team. in reality  once ford got out the kinks  it was a foregone conclusion  no matter that ferrari made amazing cars. in this regard  little was made of the genius and absolute necessity of phil remmington to the entire gt40 project  he was the actual development lead on the car and he was made out to be a disney -like character  uncle phil with almost no real role to play. well  actually  the character of miles  also an engineer on the project was a compiled character that included ""rem"" but because rem was the essential piece for gt40 development  they had to gesture towards him  i suppose. again  it was an okay movie  very much in the genre  although a bit better acted  damon and bale fighting with each other  using food  a thrown wrench  the supportive  loving wife. within the context of a buddy movie  the movie does work  but its too long and you feel it  although i did like the way miles death accident was shown  not a lot of buildup  save for the music  and then a highspeed muffled crash  no huge histrionics after and then the both true and movie cliche line ""sometimes they don't come home."" i wanted more of the internal mechanics of that  i wanted more of henry ford crying in the car  a great scene  actually because both the absolute insanity of being in a racing car as well as his joy were conveyed  i thought that was a magnificent human moment  unexpected and worth the movie  on it's own."
this is what cinema is supposed to be! amazing chemistry and acting by both leads  seamless cgi and practical effects to enhance the film  a firecracker script  a true story  pulse pounding soundtrack  booming sound mix  and edited so well that 2.5 hours flies by! completely and utterly engaging . so good in fact i saw it twice within 24 hours . once in imax and once in dolby cinema .
"""spotlight"" is an american movie from last year that runs for slightly over 2 hours and was written and directed by tom mccarthy. it won two academy awards earlier this year  including the grand prize for best picture. and the reason for this is probably that it is about a really important subject  namely the way it was discovered by a major newspaper that pedophilia was something that existed on a larger scale in the church  despite many attempts of the latter to keep it disclosed. mark ruffalo and rachel mcadams managed oscar nominations for their supporting performances. i cannot say i agree with either sadly. mcadams played her part well  had a couple good moments  but i don't think it was one of the best of the year in her category. probably more of a coattail nomination  i remember it was also pretty surprising she got in. ruffalo's nomination was no surprise  he got in at all the precursors too. but i had sometimes problems with his performance. it seem over-the-top theatrical and it had a touch of one man against the church at times  which went entirely against the idea of the team collaboratively managing great things. i am usually a fan of ruffalo and he has good moments here too  but i think a mix of not so good writing and perhaps not the best approach to the role may have hurt the character. keaton  tucci  slattery and schreiber are pretty much the same  good but not great  but probably on par with the two nominees. it was a team effort and nobody really stood out. seeing these names now i kinda think it helped mcadams with her nomination that she was the only female from the bunch.in terms of the entire film  i summarized it appropriately in the title i believe. it is a very important subject and it was a strong cast making this subject work with dignity and professionalism  but i personally felt the heart was missing. and this subject certainly would have deserved to make a more emotional impact in the grand scheme of things than it did on me. the attempts by mccarthy to deliver in terms of that were something that felt rather forced than effective to me. they brought in references to the journalists' private lives and how it impacted them to some extent  but it did not feel too compelling for me to watch these and the victims also did not add as much as i hoped they would. the ending with keaton's ""spotlight"" quote was nicely done though. i also liked the way they brought in 9/11 getting in the way of disclosing the events. overall  i believe this is an important movie that is worth watching mostly because it all happened in reality and because with the best picture win  it is probably now the defining film on a very contemporary and tragic occurrence of events. but i still feel it did not make the impact that it could have made and my favorite mccarthy film to this day stays ""the visitor"". but i recommend ""spotlight"" too of course. i would say it's nowhere near the best or worst best picture academy award winners."
"this movie undid something inside of me. it's that part of you that holds on to hope that people can be good  that there is hope for humanity. i knew the basics of it when i went to watch it: that it is about investigative reporters looking into a story of abuse in the catholic church. and it uncovered so much more than just that. honestly  this movie should be seen by anyone who seeks the true face of the world. we don't live in a pink bubble of happiness. f*cked up things happen to people all the time; worst thing is when it happens to the innocent. the little ones who can't protect themselves. when they are robbed of their faith and their hope and their future. sitting in the film theatre on the last row  i was brought to tears as in front of me a long list of places where victims spoke out was scrolling. i was both shocked and mad. i felt sorry that people can fail so miserably. ""mike rezendes: they knew and they let it happen! it could've been you  it could've been me  it could've been any of us."" indeed. when we witness darkness and we shut up and we don't do anything about it  that's when we fail. a poet once wrote  ""you can join the millions talking in the dark. or you can stand up and scream light  out into the night."" so choose to stand up. in your profession choose to eradicate the oblivion of evil. this movie is a masterpiece. from the dedication of the actors to their roles  to the script  the director and the cinematography. the score? fantastic. howard shore did it again!"
the most complex thing to think about the film prisoners is why any of the oscar nominated or recognisably 'serious' actors agreed to be in it in the first place. while it is clearly meant to be  judging by the blind critical reaction  a tense  thought provoking  violent and difficult film  i found it to be too dreary  too melodramatic  too obvious and  most importantly  too long.there are few films that can  successfully  keep me gripped for 2hrs35min. jfk is one and that other gyllenhaal detective drama zodiac is another but what they had  that prisoners forgot  was a complex  gripping detective narrative with possibly many solutions and actual characters. it is in these two areas that prisoners woefully falls short.focussing  for the moment  on the little good in the film  prisoners is very well shot by seasoned director of photography  roger deakins and not badly played by the starry  oscar grabby cast  not that they're given a whole lot to work with.that being said  my first problem with the kidnapping plot is that it was obvious. if you  like my wife and i  indulge your silly brain cells every week by watching 45min detective procedurals like the mentalist  castle  elementary  white collar or whatever  then you will see the ending of the film coming a mile away. this is because  the way it was set up and as it continued to play out  there was only a handful of ways it could play out. now  i'm sure  for those not so used to the simple twists and turns of evening tv  prisoners may have been a gripping whodunit but  i am sorry  if you've read any  even mildly  detective orientated books or watched a murder she wrote then you'll know the plot  like i did  45mins in and will have to sit there for another 1hr and 45mins waiting for surly  grumpy  tattooed jake gyllenhaal to work it out too. which he eventually does but even his  supposedly brilliant  'never lost a case' detective is beaten to the punch by 'very angry indeed' hugh jackman.gyllenhaal's detective is supposed  i am guessing  to be a tortured  dogged genius but we never see any evidence of him really doing anything insightful or perceptive  he's not a fantastic puzzle solver  good with people particularly and there doesn't appear to be a great intellect pounding away inside his furrow browed  slicked back haired head. it struck me as one of those characters him and the director talked endlessly about but forgot to put any of the motivations into the actual script. we are told in dialogue he is brilliant and we are just meant to take it as read  despite the fact that all he does is mundane and routine investigation. yes he has tattoos  a grumpy face and spends thanksgiving alone in chinese restaurants but apart from that  we have no idea what makes him tick  oh and his superiors and the police around him are also woefully inept.jackman is a survivalist  all american  possible religious nut who is also an alcoholic with an atrociously bad temper bubbling underneath a  not very interesting  surface. i was never sure if we were meant to side with him so that  we the audience  were complicit in his violent actions later on but seeing as i didn't really like him from the get go and seeing as i suspected that probably paul dano's massively red herring probably wasn't the bad guy (just by watching the trailer) that didn't really work for me. i actually found his reaction a little unrealistic and over the top but then i also found paul dano's character as annoyingly  idiotically stubborn as jackman found him. mind of a 10 year old or not  traumatised or not  i didn't buy for one second he'd stay silent for as long as he does  when he had no problem talking to gyllenhaal's character for an apparent 10hr interrogation (we're told and see on video).maria bello  viola davis & terrence howard are all shockingly underused and irrelevant (mostly) and poor melissa leo is left playing  what slides very close to being  a comical old grandma part. complete with bad clothes  huge glasses and a terrible wig. i am  personally  amazed that this film got made the way it did at all and  secondly  amazed that people love it so much. it's not that it's a bad film. it's fine. it just felt very obvious  mundane  grim and too long.
if you think of someone being a prisoner  you automatically might think of someone behind bars. but apart from a physical prison  a prisoner can also be trapped mentally  either by his own doing or by someone else. this movie that starts off pretty light gets very heavy. and it is carried by its actors. gyllenhalls characters might seem odd and out of place at the beginning  even like a cardboard cutout. but he does have more to do as the movie progresses.still front row seat is hugh jackman. and while some might argue that a female should have a bigger role in this  you only have so much time to tell a story. and this is perfectly told and cut together. it might not fit your description of entertainment (and i don't think the filmmaker would love it described as such)  but the movie is really great. if you like dramas in general you should be cherishing this .... and you will.we have a few grey areas that we visit and the ending did not satisfy everyone (i know from friends). but the movie could not have ended any other way (in my book). superb movie one of the best released in 2013
i'm not completely sure what i was expecting from fury road  but it was more than this. this is the latest example of hollywood rehashing a successful and good movie franchise solely for profit. it's mindless  repetitive action sequences melded between horrible acting and overused clichés.one of the allures of this series is seeing the outlandish road vehicles that are used  and in this the movie mostly delivers. you have the high-powered warrior rig driven by furiosa. there's battle vehicles equipped with spikes  rigs with counter-balanced poles for launching warriors into other vehicles  and there's even a vehicle equipped with large bass drums and a stack of speakers that would make kiss jealous with a psychotic guitarist wailing away for our musical enjoyment. and of course  each vehicle comes equipped with more explosive arsenal than a battle ship. and it's put to good use.however  once you get past the eye candy  you realize there's nothing else to it. the story is weak. the characters are weaker. and the acting is the worst. the movie never drew me in. not even close. whenever the movie 'tried' to add depth and be dramatic  it was painful and embarrassing to watch. the scene where furiosa reacts to finding out her birth home is gone by taking off her prosthetic arm and dropping down to her knees may be the worst movie scene i've ever watched. and it says something when the most interesting character is nux  a relentless slave/warrior who actually has a mind of his own and decides to help max and furiosa in their quest. of course  one of immortan joe's wives falls for him  representing one of the many poorly executed clichés this movie is riddled with.i can watch a superficial action movie and enjoy it for what it is  to a point. this one  however  is just generally so poorly executed that it leaves a lot to be desired. i didn't hate it  but i have absolutely no desire to see it again.
"george miller returns to live-action filmmaking with one of the greatest action films ever put to screen. 'mad max: fury road' is ridiculous in all the right ways.for those who have seen the original films and loved them  you'll fall in love all over again with this film. tom hardy takes the reigns this time around as max - a man of few words who has been hardened by the world in which he lives. along with him is charlize theron as imperator furiosa - a woman who seeks redemption by helping five young '""wives"" escape from the film's antagonist.leading up to the film's release  many speculated if this would be just another action film that lacks a solid narrative and motive  but i am happy to say that this is simply not the case. yes  the film does fill 80% of its run-time with action sequences  but it never gets in the way of the humanity between these characters that miller has brought to life. there are some emotional moments. specifically  with theron's character. is the story something we haven't seen before? not at all. but in a film loaded with action  it's nice to see a solid narrative.now  how about those action sequences? incredible - exhilarating - jaw-dropping. george miller has put together some of the greatest  most memorable action set-pieces ever. one thing that sets the action in this film apart from a good majority of mediocre action films today is that every action the character's make have an affect on them. for good and for bad. the action is not pointless. it's motivated. and it's glorious to behold thanks to the use of practical effects  incredible stunt work and stunning cinematography.'mad max: fury road' has set a new standard for action films. it's arguably the greatest action film of the 21st century. it's that good. george miller has brought back what we loved about 80's action films while also brining new ideas to the table. it's the best time i've had in a theater in a long time  and i couldn't help but laugh in appreciation of the ridiculousness that was unfolding before my eyes. the film left me feeling giddy  with a big smile on my face."
despite all the rave reviews  which i don't understand  i didn't think this movie was made very well. it was mainly the acting and the writing. clint eastwoods performance was great  but everybody else was bad. from the young preacher to the main hmong characters the acting was forced and you could tell that all these people had never done a movie before  which according to imdb is mostly true.right off the bat you saw the actor who played the preacher was of considerably less caliber than anyone else in the scenes. the hmong actor during a climatic scene with clint eastwood seemed fake  forced and just not very good. again if everybody was that bad maybe no one would have noticed but they were up against a veteran actor  so it was quite noticeable.the writing was a little empty and it didn't take a guru to see right through the plot.i know clint eastwoods movies are plain movies  usually low budget  with fresh new actors  and simple plot lines  with the exception of his latest wwii movies and mystic river. although the revenue must be very high for this movie cause i'm sure it was dirt cheap to make considering all the aspects  but this certainly isn't a must see even if it is his last acting movie.
"i feel like i should let everyone reading this know of my inherent bias in favor of this film. i have seen twenty eight films from clint eastwood as director and have liked the vast majority of them  and loved a good number of them (my average rating for the 28 films is 7.9). still  something felt off about ""gran torino"" based on the trailer. i read it as eastwood trying to be 'badass' again  trying to be dirty harry again. ""gran torino"" is not that. walt kowalski may have similarities with dirty harry  and could possibly be read as a significantly older version of harry (it's a stretch)  but he is a distinctive  memorable character on his own  and i'd go as far as saying that it's one of eastwood's finest performances  and one which gives him a chance to show off his dramatic and comedic chops.i'm not going to argue that ""gran torino"" has perfect acting from the younger supporting cast. it doesn't. in fact  some of them are downright bad at times  but the film works in spite of its flaws. this screenplay was probably written with eastwood in mind (i am not sure of the behind-the-scenes details on this) and it shows. he captures kowalski perfectly. the film is surprisingly humorous  something that isn't being captured well enough in advertising. it's absolutely hilarious at times (watch as kowalski attempts to make a man out of thao by teaching him how to talk like men do)  and eastwood handles the shifts in tone brilliantly. when the film takes a dark turn towards the end i sat on the edge of my seat in suspense  fully aware of where it was heading but still mesmerized by eastwood's tour-de-force direction. this is an artist at his prime as an actor and as a director.whether or not ""gran torino"" will hold up as one of eastwood's great films remains to be seen  and the film feels like it would be good for multiple viewings. the characterization is strong and not simplistic at all  you could argue that kowalski is just another grouchy war vet  but eastwood's beautiful  nuanced performance as well as some neat little touches in the screenplay (particularly towards the end) which i won't discuss in detail to avoid spoiling anything (and it's really fun to watch this movie unfold  eastwood keeps the film moving at a wonderfully involving pace) would prove you wrong. the film works on yet another level as a deconstruction of eastwood's image. i don't mean that as a negative  it just adds to the film's strength as a character study.it's a more intimate film than eastwood's other film this year  ""changeling""  and also on a smaller scale than many of his other films  but it's just as ambitious in many ways. this is not a politically correct film about a grouchy old racist suddenly turning into the most tolerant person around  it is a film about a man who  near the end of his life  is forced to confront his demons  and on the sunnier side about a man who finds true friendship where he least expected it. by the end of ""gran torino"" i had forgiven any flaws it might have  and was completely satisfied with the film  which far exceeded my expectations. i have a feeling that ""gran torino""  which has already been met with strongly positive reviews (but is still being described as a 'minor' eastwood film by some)  will eventually become an especially important part of eastwood's filmography."
"harry potter and the deathly hallows  part 2 also known as the movie that tore my heart and soul into oblivion. if you thought goosebumps was the criteria for a good scene  then mix those goosebumps with emotional upheaval  coupled with your hands almost shaking and this is deathly hallows part 2 in its entirety.harry  ron and hermione are still on the pursuit to collect and destroy voldemort's horcruxes. they believe the next one is hidden away in bellatrix lestrange's vault in gringotts  the wizarding bank. but going into the bank is near impossible – unless you know a goblin who worked there  which they do. and so a deal is stricken. at gringotts  they are discovered to be impostors. hearts will race as they try to escape with the horcrux and as harry soon finds out the next one is hidden inside hogwarts and it's something that belongs to another founder of the school. and it is to hogwarts that he goes. but hogwarts has changed. snape is the new headmaster.but there are many things that harry doesn't know  the ultimate secret being one that revolves around his every being. things are never as it seems. people will show their true colors and they will come out as triumphant even after years of hatred.dan radcliffe  rupert grint and emma watson have done the impossible here. they are possibly the only set of actors that you have seen grow up on the big screen and as the actors grew up on a personal level  they added their maturity to their characters. it's very fascinating to watch them interact. their acting is relentless  captivating and charming as it should be now that they have mastered the characters they're playing. you cannot imagine other actors portraying harry and ron or another actress to portray hermione. alan rickman and maggie smith as snape and professor mcgonagall respectively gave their all in this movie. you cannot help but be on the edge of your seat whenever any of these two actors are doing their thing. rickman has a part of the movie entirely dedicated to his character's personal story. it is also one of my favorite parts of the book. the prince's tale is transferred so magnificently on screen that it will bring you to tears.professor mcgonagall takes a stand – several  actually – in deathly hallows as well. she stands up for a harry and when she does  the whole theater will explode in applause. maggie smith fortifying hogwarts and then cracking a joke to lighten up the mood just the way i like it. you cannot but share the pain in smith's eyes as she sees her beloved school crumbling around her  as she sees all the work that they've done go to waste and what better actor to portray this generation's most bad-ass villain than ralph fiennes. he gives his character an extra dimension in this movie now that he has the room to spread his wings so to speak  seeing as he's one of the movie's main pillars. lord voldemort is all evil. but in this movie  another side of him shows up: anguish and misery. and yet  there's this subtlety to the nuances of the portrayal that make up the overall result to be very epic  indeed.steve kloves is the movie's screenwriter. he captured the movie's essence perfectly. he presented j.k. rowling's work in such a brilliant way that even the slight deviations from the book (and they are very few) do not even matter anymore. he portrays the gravity of the situation to the letter: the deaths  the destruction  the revelations  the build-up. his version of the story is so well done that it would be incredible not to see an oscar nod (and a win!) for him in the screenplay category. he added his touch while keeping rowling's magic. some of the lines from the book are transferred to the movie as they are and for someone who has read the book over and over again  i was ecstatic to hear them on screen. ""look atme."" enough said.director david yates has helmed the last four potter movies and while i had my doubts about him at first (order of the phoenix was not exactly great)  he more than surpassed my wildest expectations in this. the pace he sets for the movie never dies down. it keeps on building up and up like a beautiful orchestral crescendo. he guides his actors and actresses with confidence. he's working with a marvelous script based on a terrific book. and he has the green light to give it all out. what do you expect from a very talented director with those options? something not less than magical.harry potter and the deathly hallows  part 2 provides you with a sense of catharsis as it ends. it lets your senses go. it lowers your inhibitions more than alcohol. you cannot help but see your hands automatically clap at some points in the movie. you shout in desperation without even controlling your voice and you root for your characters like they're really in front of you. tears flow down your face without any power of you to stop them. there isn't any better way to end the epic series that was harry potter. if only it weren't ending"
what can i say... this was by far the most amazing finale any fan could have asked for. i cried  i laughed  i was short of breath in many instances  i was disturbed  but overall i was thoroughly satisfied with the conclusion of this series. i felt something amazing after the movie ended  something i didn't feel after reading the book. being able to watch the end of harry potter on the big screen really brought the impact of just how much this series has touched not only my life  but the lives of everyone around me. deathly hallows part 2 is by far (in my opinion) the best movie of 2011 and quite possibly one of the best movies of all time. i don't want to give any spoilers i just want to express how happy i am with this film. it picks up where part 1 left off  all of the characters get the closure they deserve  and the story just comes full circle!bravo!!! that is all i have to say. thank you to everyone involved in these movies for taking the world on such an amazing journey. j.k rowling  thank you for writing such a masterpiece that will truly live on in my heart  and so many others hearts for years to come.go see this movie!
"in bedridge  professor parker wilson (richard gere) finds an abandoned dog in the train station and brings the dog home with the intention of returning the animal to its owner. he finds that the dog is an akita and names it hachiko; however  nobody claims the dog and his family decides to keep hachi. along the years  the popular hachi waits for wilson in the square in front of the station. when wilson dies at school  hachi keeps waiting for his owner along the years until the day the meet each other. i was quite anxious waiting for the release of ""hachiko: a dog's story"" on dvd. i had read in the newspaper the story of the japanese dog that had waited for nine years for his deceased owner in the 20's in japan and i expected a good adaptation of this story of loyalty and love by lasse hallström. this melodramatic movie has a great cast  with richard gere  joan allen and the dogs that should be nominated to the oscar with their expressions and acting  better than many actors and actresses that we frequently see on the screen. be ready for tears and bring handkerchiefs and tissues together with the popcorn to the sofa  and watch a really beautiful movie with your family. my vote is seven.title (brazil): ""sempre ao seu lado"" (""always at your side"")"
well what can i say. i'm a guy i don't cry about movies i know its fake but i gotta say this one caught me by surprise even tho id watched the trailer and read a few reviews already. by the end of the movie i was in tears absolutely broken down crying my eyes out. and saying that i probably haven't shed a tear in about 8 years for anything but i love dogs and this is the most amazing story i've ever seen this is probably the best movie i've seen in about 10 years and i have seen almost everything.as u can prob tell i would advise everyone to see this and stop and think for a moment if we all cared for each other like we know we should like this movie teaches us wouldn't the world be a better place?
there's a constant stream of animated films these days  but mostly they're either glossy hollywood product (pixar/dreamworks)  or japanese anime. for adults wanting something different we have to wait for the likes of the nightmare before christmas  waltz with bashir  persepolis  or aardman's films to turn up. mary & max is one of these films that comes as a complete departure from all the others  both in visual and storytelling style  and sticks in the mind because of it. i won't repeat the plot here  so i'll just mention a few pros and cons. the cons are obvious. some people will be put off by the almost constant narration (which took me a while to get used to)  the rather numerous calamities (a lot more than you'd expect if you thought this was just a kids film)  and the sadness within some of these people's stories. it's actually a little surprising that the film got made without the people financing it demanding a script that was more tailored to appeal to a wider audience. what we get is something that feels a whole lot more personal than the higher profile animated films. it feels personal  and therefore real  and the explanation is that it was written from life by a director who has a real feeling and sympathy for people who don't quite fit into the world  and feel alienated or are misunderstood by others. mary was partly inspired by the director's own childhood (and there's a little bit of toni collette's muriel heslop thrown in i suspect)  and max is also based on a real person he's been pen friends with (but so far has never met in person). the way the film handles his asperger's syndrome just feels different to how you'd normally see such an issue handled on screen. there's a constant stream of humour (ironic  black  childish)  and i really enjoyed the small perfect touches on growing up in an australian suburb in the 70's and 80's  and the depiction of grey new york  as it appears to the easily frightened max. the animation is constantly a joy to watch  and i highly recommend seeing it on the big screen where it can be properly appreciated in all it's hand-made glory.
coming from australia  mary and max is one of these few films you'll remember all your life. this amazing claymation touches upon an unlikely friendship between two pen pals: a young girl living in australia and an aging jew from new york. it's unbelievable what a precisely structured narrative this is. director-writer adam elliot blends odd scatological  yet clever humour with poignant dramatizations to a splendid effect creating one of the best tragicomedies of the past few years. the fact that it's in the form of claymation only helps to enhance uniqueness of the whole experience. the movie was 5 years in the making and this is visible in its every frame. elliot masterly captures the motion in an endlessly creative manner. most importantly though  his lovably oddball characters are well developed and admirably complex with all their awkward traits and quirks. due to its serious themes and dark tone  mary and max is an adult movie aiming much higher than its big studio counterparts. it happens to be more contemplative  and intelligent mimicking the real life with all its ups and downs. calling elliot's movie an extraordinary piece of art is certainly not an overstatement.
i am not at all interested in dragons and all such fantasy creatures. i don't like children movies with all their stupid messages. i saw this movie rather just to pass the time than to watch it for its sake. and whoa! i was drawn in this river in first 5 minutes. and what a experience it has been! right from the start as the narrator describes his world  you are immediately there. you feel yourself in the characters place. the movie does that for you. this is very uncommon movie and it has set a milestone for 3d  not because of its technical aspects  but because of the depth this movie has. this movie is as much for a 7 year old as it is for an old man who has seen a lot of life. this movie will entertain each viewer in his own way. this is a masterpiece! this movie isn't what it sounds on the surface. it has layers of meanings attached to it. look at just the title: how to train your dragon!. if you see it carefully you will notice that there is more to it than meets the eye. watch the movie and you will know what i mean. this movie cleverly comments on human fear  war  friendship  prejudices  courage  love. ........................... don't miss this movie or you will miss one of the few periods when you really live. note: just remember to carry your heart with you when you see this movie. it will fill your heart with nothing but what should truly belong there. 10/10.
i watched how to train your dragon about 5 times now  and it never gets boring. it actually keeps on getting better and better with with more and more views. this is a huge accomplishment for dreamworks animation  it might actually be its best animated feauture it yet. it is an amazing experience to watch this film in cinema. the 3d is amazing and at times breathtaking. i may of had the most fun that i've ever had in cinema watching how to train your dragon.the script is really good and is has a lot of dramatic depth. this movie is for everyone. adults and kids will enjoy it equally and will love it at the end. this movie will probably become a series like shrek. but i'm hoping this film doesn't get bad sequels like shrek 3 and shrek forever after. anyways this film will be most recognized for its beautiful animation.10/10 highly recommended
honestly let me just say this 1st sean pean made this story come to life  true life in every moment in the film. this movie has nothing wrong with it  it is perfect in every way shape and form. he did something that brought me to something i never could understand of what either i have to do or what i need to do in my life. if you want a movie from the heart this is it  if you want a movie of love this is it  if you want a movie with real life emotions well this is all of them. its long but you'll probably want more when you don't want to leave your seat and just live in the moment of they story. so from my heart to yours this movie will speak to you know matter what.
"i've never posted a comment regarding a movie but feel compelled to after attending a screening of into the wild at the toronto film festival last night. i won't speak to story here as it's covered in the other comments.this is a movie of real beauty. it made me cry. i felt moved in a way that happens very rarely. it was an inspiration.the feelings it evoked were all based on the power of the acting and the writing. the words were real and human. the relationships seemed real and human. this may not seem like a great feat - but i consider it a true rarity. it didn't feel calculated and artificial  like so many movies (read: crash - but i'm not here to bash that...). it was very organic  natural and (i can't say it enough) just beautiful. cripes  it's making me sound like a hippie  for heaven's sake. this for me was penn's best work since indian runner.what it reminded me of...terence malik - herzog? - in a strange way cassavettes? - hal ashby (more coming home than harold & maude...) - even a bit of ken loachruby in paradise - alice doesn't live here anymore - five easy pieces - easy rider... but when i list those it's not because of plot similarities (though there are some) or style (although i think you can definitely see the influence of some great films) - it's again because of the heart of it. i heard a few people at the screening comment that the film was ""too long"" but i don't agree. i think exploring a journey of this magnitude required visiting all of the people he touched and taking the time to see the land.hal holbrook was just perfect  as was the cast as a whole  and i think emile hirsch is really going places - he was fantastic and he owned the role. eddie vedder's music worked perfectly as well - not distracting or quirky - just a part of the whole.the film received a standing ovation and quite a few tears were shed. magic."
i have a plea out on the message boards for someone to please explain this movie to me. i love movies and i am not one of those who insist on only being hand fed obvious characters and plots. i enjoy movies that make you think and use symbolism. but i honestly did not understand this film. im not saying its horrible but i will say i don't think it deserves the ratings it is getting. i personally rated it a 1 because i feel compelled to balance out the absurd over ratings it is getting.what i saw was two men fighting over the same two million dollars. one who is somewhat good and obviously poor and the other who is this maniac psycho killer. im not even sure its his money  how he knows about it or why he even wants it. none of that was clarified.the good guy is running with the money the bad guy is chasing him the sheriff seems like he is supposed to be chasing them but doesn't really want to and would rather be some sort of hillbilly philosopher about the whole thing.then the good guy suddenly dies. the bad guy escapes death by the skin of his teeth again the money disappears and the sheriff retires but not becoming so philosophical that the whole movie just ends right there at his dinner table with him rambling on about some dreams he had.again i would love to figure out this movie.i am a 40 year old movie buff academy award trivia expert i own over 700 movies i've been a member here for 6 years and i have a college degree.maybe i ate too many milk duds or something but it went right over my head.if you are looking for a donnie darko  eternal sunshine of the spotless mind must see a second or third time to fully understand kind of movie then go for it!if you think you are going to see a titanic  the green mile or silence of the lambs kind of movie where the plot unfolds at a normal pace and doesn't make you search for answers and meaning then don't go see this thing. again  not a bad movie. great acting  cinematography  pace.... the works... just incredibly difficult to understand after the first half.in fact the first half is very good  suspenseful.. second half does not fulfill. leaves you hanging and wanting more.ok im done. thanks for reading.
the message of this film is that there is no symmetry to life. what goes around does not come around. the fall of the coin has no bearing on the way the cookie crumbles. there is no right or wrong to the fates of men. no justice. opportunities seized may lead on to fortune  but they could just as well lead on to dusty death. only children expect things to be fair. as things once were they need no longer be. now that imdb has decided to list reviews by date there is a slightly increased possibility that this effort will be read by someone. performance reviews are absolutely not read by me for helpfulness  but for interest and entertainment.
"""million dollar baby"" is the story of three different characters actually  two of them  frankie dunn (eastwood) and scrap iron (freeman) are pretty much mirror images of each otherfrankie owns a rundown los angeles gym where he trains up-and-comers his motto for his fighters is ""protect yourself at all times."" scrap is an elderly ex-boxer who helps out around the gym and keeps frankie company frankie was the 'cut-man' in one of scraps' fights that turned bad frankie still feels he's partly to blame but 31 year old maggie (hilary swank) is totally different she works as a waitress but aspires to be a boxer she is so poor that she has to pick leftover meat off her customers' plates just to have the energy to keep going maggie needs boxing to make something of herself and gain respect when she first approaches frankie  asking to be trained  he told her he never trains girls she continues to hang around and after much harassment he eventually changes his mind from there  we begin to feel some natural affinity between the twoto say more would be to ruin a lovely  heartbreaking film carefully layered with surprisesbeneath ""million dollar baby "" there is a love story a deep love story between two people with scars in their lives... both are haunted by family problems maggie's family  led by her opportunistic mother is alternately cruel and exploitative frankie has an unloving daughter he writes to constantly  but his letters always returned unopened  unread and intact we never know what came between themeastwood handles his role with such ease that it's hard to judge whether his acting or directing is the greater accomplishment he stands as a challenge to his conscience when he finds the correct answer in his heart"
"""million dollar baby"" has great characters  but it doesn't glorify them. it has a wonderful story  but it never tries to impress you. the photography  score and direction is superb  but never distracting. what this movie is  if i have to call it something  is passion. passion for film-making  passion for storytelling  passion for its characters  passion for its actors  and passion for its story and the means at which it will go to tell it. amazing.frankie dunn (clint eastwood) owns a messy boxing gym which is populated  mostly  by downbeat losers who he spends some time training. he runs it with his friend and former student eddie scrap-iron dupris (morgan freeman)  who now lives contently at a room in the gym. one day a young woman named maggie (hilary swank) walks in  looking for a manager and trainer. frankie shafts her immediately (""girly  tough ain't enough""). frankie has bigger things on his hands. he's managing a fighter who has a shot at a title bout.but frankie is old and weathered and not an appealing manager  so the fighter leaves him. frankie is broken by this; it is another in a long line of rejections and separations. we can tell that  at this time in his life  he only gets really close with those he's training (scrap is the only exception). we can tell that his loneliness  and a bit of persuasion from scrap  cause him to agree to teach maggie. teach  that is the agreement  not manage. but  by the end of the film he will have devoted his life to her.so the rest of the story follows these two people. there is no real 'plot' that you could describe in a trailer because it is constantly changingit is not the inspiring underdog story you may think of it as. no  what it's 'about' is these characters  and how they react to the circumstances around them  which change with each scene.narrating the story is scrap  speaking like he's looking back to a time long ago when everything has passed. his voice seems flat  deadpan  but there is a working of subtle sorrow in it. scrap is a sad human being  he sees himself as the result of missed opportunities in the past  and so he spends his time helping the others  offering them his wise advice  with a tone of deadpan humor and even cockiness. scrap knows what should be done  and what will happen regardless  and he is sort of okay with everything  in a sort of passive way. but the man also knows what's right and he has a deep  inner strength which is displayed in one scene in particular where you just have to cheer. it is an intriguing character  and personally i think it's freeman's best performance.and eastwood's best too. he is an elderly man; some might say too elderly to still be working. after all  most people are retired by his age. but if you had to guess when you're watching this film  you would never  ever say the man is seventy-four. you would say something closer to the sixties  because the man has such amazing energy and dedication  and above all  he has talent. it's been forty long years since ""a fist full of dollars"" and film has come a long way  and so has this man. at seventy-four  passed all those years as an action hero  nearing what's could be the end of his career  eastwood has made his best movie. i really  really hope he has time to make many more.as for swank  well  she must have found something big that she shared with her character  because this is not acting  it is existing. swank is maggie. that's all there is too it. this could be the movie she will be remembered for.so  ""million dollar baby"" is a masterpiece. i saw it last night when it opened in my city  and everyone else was seeing ""white noise""  and i was shaking my head. everyone who is even remotely interested in movies should see this one  just so they can know how movies are supposed to be made. i'm trying to think  and there is not a single thing here where eastwood went wrong. the acting  directing  writing  score  cinematographythey all accomplish precisely what they're supposed to with sublime perfection. many of these aspects will certainly receive oscars and all of them should.you may cry through this film  you may cheer. whatever the case  you will love it.9/10."
"the basic hurdle for the world to have more empathy with the macro issue of the horrendous massacre is the fact that the world is uninformed. unlike the situation of nazis and jews  irish catholics and british protestants or crusade and islam  the issue of tutsi and hutu in rwanda has not generally been heard of by an average citizen of the world. in the movie  the reporter asks two women at the bar in hotel rwanda what tribe they belong to. ""hutu"" says one  and ""tutsi""  the other. the reported turns around and comments to his companion ""they look like twins to me"". that says a lot.the film does educate us on the brief background of the local history  on how the belgians used the tutsi's to rule the hutu and so since they left  the hutu had been waiting for their chance to revenge. that is however just the bare backbone of the history  but we have not been brought to a deeper understanding of the bitter hatred that drove the hutus to a diabolical genocide of a million tutsi in 1994 as the world turned its back: ""the nations are united in their indifference towards rwanda"" as mr. ebert aptly puts it.rather than being an epic on macro scale  hotel rwanda is a personal story (albeit a true one) on micro scale  about hotel manager paul rusesabagina's heroic efforts which saved twelve hundred hotel ""guests"" of tutsi descent  including his own wife. this is a story told with high quality filming and yet one cannot help but come away feeling that it leans slightly towards looking like a hollywood thriller. it would be gross injustice to say it's crafted and yet  the climax after climax of narrow escape and cliffhanging suspense does feel a tad hollywood. it would be gross injustice to say that it's a tearjerker and yet one cannot help feeling traces of familiarity in the hollywood style emotional pull. and there is considerable predictability  such as the sudden bumpy ride of the jeep in the fog would be easily discerned by a regular moviegoer as the signal for the next scene: a road strewn with bodies of massacred victims.oscar nominee don cheadle's performance as the circumstance-driven hero is deservedly recognized by the nomination. nick notle  who was wonderful in ""clean""  puts in another great performance here as a similarly circumstance-driven hero in the u.n. peace keeping force col. oliver. the rest of the cast contributing to making this film a solid success includes sophie okonedo who was nominated for best supporting actress as pauls's wife tatiana and joaquin phoenix as the reporter whose videotape of the massacre made the world pay attention. all told  hotel rwanda is a high-quality movie  but i can't agree with many comments hailing hotel rwanda as another schindler's list."
anything i say in this review is probably redundant  because there isn't a single negative review in all the comments so far here  and i agree wholeheartedly with what has been said by other reviewers.nevertheless hotel rwanda is that rare kind of movie experience that doesn't easily relinquish its hold on the audience just because the credits have rolled. watching with a friend  after ten minutes we had to pause the film because we decided we would be better served if we were more informed about what the basic facts of the conflict in rwanda were. so to my shame  we had to read on the internet about what really happened  before we could continue. i say shame because we should have known  both of us were of an age when it happened to have taken more of an interest in world politics.the film is beautifully understated  eschewing sentimentality in favour of raw emotion and letting the story tell itself. the acting was flawless - don cheadle's breathtaking performance being a particular standout - and the direction didn't falter  despite all the potential pitfalls of dramatising a recent and horrific conflict. the scenes which were hardest to watch in terms of tension and violence were often suffused with humour and hope.it's difficult sometimes to separate the significance of the true story  from the artistry of the product  and often i get impatient with 'worthy' movies scoring big at oscar time because it seems as though important stories ought to be rewarded  whether or not they make good films. however  i can't recall being so profoundly moved by a film since i saw the grey zone  and i hope hotel rwanda gets all the plaudits it deserves.
"before sunset is one of those movies  you either love  or you hate.personally  i loved it.now  i recommend watching ""before sunrise"" first  however it isn't necessary. before sunset does a good job of reviewing what had happened  therefore if you decide to watch it before watching ""sunrise"" you have nothing to worry about.some scenes are extremely well done. the characters are picture perfect  and the movie itself  is breathtaking. the aura of the movie is so spectacular  that it will inspire young directors out there  to pick up their video cameras are start filming.an 80 minute movie  about two lovable characters and what they have to say  may sound boring. but the way it's done in before sunset  will sweep this impression right off your feet. julie and ethan play two of the most honest and true characters i have ever seen  they are known as jesse and celine. and while much of the credit must go to the characters themselves  you musn't forget the actor and actress who played them.julie is perfect as celine. the young french actress is so natural in front of the camera. definitely  has potential. ethan is also very very honest  he seems so comfortable character that that you forget your watching a movie  and not a home-made video.both play with such honest expression  and such trueness  that they are so natural  before sunset becomes no longer a movie. it feels as if you are eavesdropping on two extremely developed people. it's such an intimate environment  that you never want to leave.before sunset... 9.901/10*****"
"there are four scenes that i will treasure forever:1) the ferry ride  and the subtle ways you can tell they're both heartbroken  lonely  frustrated and angry. the way she discusses the ""little details"" that compose a person  and what she missed most in him. ""like i remember the way your beard has a bit of red it in  and how the sun was making it glow that...that morning right before you left.""2) the scene in the van  where they finally unburden themselves. one of the most emotionally raw and honest interplays i've seen on celluloid. the way she reaches out to touch him  but holds back at the last second. much different in tone from the way hawke reached out to brush her hair aside in the first film.3) celine's song. so simple yet so endearing. the way her voice fades to a whisper as she sings  ""my heart will be yours until i die.""4) the ending  which is in all ways **perfect**. the slow fade  the utter charm of her nina simone impression  the ambiguity  and the wonderful look in his eyes as his youth  hope and happiness come rushing back to him while watching celine dancing and singing (foreshadowed in the opening scene). this is  perhaps  one of the ten best endings in the cinema.hawke and delpy are sublime  of course. this film requires incredibly subtle acting  and these are oscar worthy performances that will not be recognized because they are not showy. much of this film  like life  is acted with the eyes. witness how hawke stares at delpy as she discusses her failed relationships on the ferry  or the sadness and longing in delpy's eyes as she sings her love song. as in the first film  the chemistry between them is indelible. my candidate for best on-screen couple ever.this film is better than the first  because it provides a more unique perspective. in sunset  we see the sobering effects of age and disappointment etched in their faces and clouding their lives. there is more at stake here  for they are nine years older  have made their share of mistakes  feel imprisoned by responsibilities  and must confront their shortcomings and problems. it's comforting to believe that hope and love will prevail in their case."
sadly  this is loosely based on a true story  but the killer was finally caught a couple of weeks ago 33 years after the murders.dark  gritty and humorous at times in a way only korean film can pull off.if you're an avid fan of the serial killer genre this is an absolute must see.
i read a review about this movie and am aware what business it made in korea  but nothing (i mean nothing) prepares me for this great work. with the exception of  perhaps  se7en  serial-killer movie has never been this good. the story (about real-life killings of 10 women in korea during the 1986-1991) is compelling enough  but the actors (song kang-ho cuts you deep even when he's silent  and his big-city partner offers emotional jolts at the end)  the director (effectively plays some scenes in docu-style approach)  the cinematography (a shadow creeps out in the paddy field will give you  well  creeps. big one.)  and the music (haunting) are welcome bonuses.one scene that impresses me most is the crime-scene midnight chase between a suspect  2 local detectives  and a big-city detective (who doesn't know his local partners are there watching him). humorously intense  or intensely humorous  whichever serves you well.the only regret is i saw this one on dvd  while i believe a movie this big (in many senses) deserves to be seen in theaters. korean movies rarely touch indonesian theaters.**** out of ****try to listen the song sad letter in this movie and tell me it's not haunting you. a magnum opus.
the biggest overrated nonsense since the blair witch project. if you like cheap chinese b-movies  then i guess you'll love this load of garbage.  it was ok for about the first 20 minutes  then it becomes untolerable. 2/10
having seen tarantino's 3 previous films  going into the cinema  my expectations for 'kill bill' were already over the roof. however  regardless of my high hopes for quality entertainment  i was not prepared for this film. i was dumbfounded. i was blown away. i had quite simply never seen anything even remotely like it.in 'kill bill'  the revenge plot serves only as a larger story arc  thus allowing tarantino to play with as many different genres as he likes  and boy - what a mix he dishes out! with complete disregard for the conventions of filmmaking  he paints an expressionistic masterpiece in his own unique style  the likes of which the world has never seen before. cinema rarely gets this exciting. with 'kill bill'  tarantino proved once and for all that all the hype around his persona is justified: he is the most daring  original - and entertaining! - filmmaker of his generation. simply amazing: 10 stars out of 10.lesser-known masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/favorite low-budget and b-movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/all-time favorite films: http://www.imdb.com/list/mkjokvqlsbs/
"fresh off a viewing in a packed theater of kids and parents  my initial impression of ""finding nemo"" was that i had a great time throughout  but don't necessarily remember why.  the film is similar to the ""toy story"" pacing  in that we follow two different protagonists in their attempt to return to one another.  in brief summary  marlin the overprotective father clownfish must overcome his own fear of open ocean to try and find his only son  nemo  who has been captured by a diver and transplanted to an ocean-view dentist's office fish tank.the visual impact of ""finding nemo"" is unparalleled in animated film.  at its best  it compares to the experience of seeing the sweeping landscapes of ""fellowship of the ring"" for the first time - not until we own the dvd and my son has watched it a dozen times will i really have an opportunity to see the details crammed into the lush backgrounds of the coral reefs.  it was noticeable  however  that frequent close-ups in open water were used to reduce the amount of time spent rendering those brilliant backgrounds.  in comparison to pixar films like ""a bug's life""  where every moment of the film includes rich textures and detailed background perspective  this seemed jarring at times.  it should be noted that this is true to what the ocean looks like - if you're not diving in a coral reef  you are probably seeing a lot of floating detritus and gray water - but it's worth mentioning that the fish tank environment of nemo and his fellow captives is  at times  more interesting than the open ocean.pixar took chances (or else saved money) with many of the voice actors used in the film.  it was refreshing not to instantly ""know"" a voice was familiar in the case of many of the characters - all of them did a serviceable job  although the well-known actors also turned in some of the best performances. ellen degeneres had no fear as the voice of dory  gleefully pulling off vocal pratfalls that would have been hampered by someone else's sense of dignity.  i can think of only one other actress - julia louis-dreyfuss - who i think would have been able to do dory well.  kudos to ellen.  willem dafoe is also noticeably brilliant as gill  and it's a bonus that the animated character he plays is gorgeously realized.  john ratzenberger does a hysterical turn as the school of fish we all saw in the previews.i am surprised at the number of characters whose voices are not credited in this film.  i wanted to know  among others  who voiced mr. ray the schoolteacher and the trio of parents with whom marlin banters.i laughed out loud frequently and heartily throughout the film  but at the end  i looked back and wondered how those moments of amusement added to the story.  many people have commented that they loved the 12-step program for sharks (""fish are our friends  not food!"") but in the final analysis  it added very little to the arc and seemed out of character (i realize i'm stating the obvious).  the frequently-dropped comedic digressions were the weak point in this picture  especially compared to ""a bug's life""  where the funniest moments of the film are all critical to the progress of the protagonist and impact the end of the story.my 2 and a half year old son was frequently frightened to the point of crying out and grabbing on to me during the movie  and he followed the primary issues easily.  at a particular moment in the film when things seemed hopeless  i heard dozens of young children beginning to cry.  if your child is very affected by scary or dramatic moments in movies  you may want to talk with them about ""pretend"" versus ""real"" and prepare them for the eventuality that everything will turn out all right well before you go into the theater.  his final analysis was that ""the fish movie was good!"" - so take it under advisement if you have kids of similar age.i give ""finding nemo"" an 8 out of 10 on the strength of its visual lushness  its enjoyable voice work  and its moments of perfectly timed humor.  it does not  in my opinion  match the strength as a *film* of earlier pixar offerings  but even in its innocuous state  it's higher quality than most of the family films i've seen in the past 3 years."
marlin  a nervous and neurotic clownfish is heavily overprotective of his son nemo  who only wants to explore the sea in its entirety. when nemo gets caught by a scuba diver and taken away  it is up to marlin to swallow his own fears and find nemo. the ensuing search and rescue organized by the him is a mass effort by swimming and flying creatures of all sizes and personalities  such as a threesome of vegetarian sharks  a fish with short term memory and an aged turtle  all helping him realise the error of his ways in restricting himself to just his home.as charming as it is beautiful  finding nemo is a joy  both visually and cinematically. the characters are all so appealing and sweet that you want to hug each and every one of them  nemo and dory in particular. but the film transcends above just a generic animated film  for there are lessons to be learnt by it too. the film often tells a children's tale from an adult's point of view  with risky situations and emotional soul-searching putting stress on a disjointed family.the sea is brought to us in such a memorable and unique way that there is brilliance and beauty in every frame. the animation is of all time high for pixar  and the sound mixing and editing are also to be credited  as they capture the heart of the sea creditably. but perhaps the best thing about the film is the musical score by thomas newman. he creates the essence of the sea  as well as the emotions felt by the fish throughout. note the masterwork that occurs as an upbeat  jovial number quickly escalates into something darker in a matter of minutes. in short  the music is superb.the voice cast are capable and cannily chosen  from young alexander gould as the naïve nemo  as well as albert brooks as the bumbling marlin. but the star of the show is ellen degeneres as dory. as the forgetful but caring fish  she is sweet and soulful  and provides much of the comedy of the film. but the humour is also provided by the great script  which delivers a potentially dull story with wit and soul  and shies away from the sentimentality that could so easily arise of a disney film. and the jokes  what jokes  from satire  spoof and slapstick  they'll be a one-liner for everybody here.gorgeous to look at and utterly adorable  finding nemo sets the standard for how animated movies should being terms of entertainment value as well as story and themes  ending with the touching  thought-provoking message of how too much protectiveness on the parent's side will repel  but  no matter how independent a child (or fish) believes themselves to be  they'll always need their parents.
"at first i thought i was going to see a lightweight film from a great director but instead i watched another impressive achievement by steven spielberg. a few things stand out and of course the performances are terrific. leonardo dicaprio is believable as a guy that can convince people that he's someone else. dicaprio is a charmer and is very smooth as we watch his character do some fancy talk to the young ladies. tom hanks as the fbi agent reminds me of his cynical character that he played in ""a league of their own"" and his mere presence adds more to this film. the sign of a great film star. and christopher walken gives one of his best performances in his already interesting career. the last scene of him as he talks to his son in the restaurant is so moving that it reflects on the great talent of walken. you can understand why dicaprio admires and loves his father. walken conveys these emotions and makes the audience react just accurately. i'll be rooting for him at oscar time. another impressive thing about this film is the beautiful cinematography by janusz kaminski who's a real artist with a camera and has worked on several spielberg films. one shot in particular stands out. the ray of sunshine coming in through the kitchen window on walken. very thought provoking. and of course since its a spielberg film its very personal. spielberg was interested in the frank abagnale character because as a youngster he also came from a broken family and wanted to be someone else. spielberg would sneak onto the studios and tell people that he worked there. also  the real frank abagnale jr. appears as a french police officer. well made  extremely well acted and sharply written. viewers seem to forget that this is really a film about the breaking up of a family and the aftermath. this really is a personal film from spielberg  and a very good one."
"from the opening credits design we get in the mood of this very entertaining film. they create the tone for what will follow. steven spielberg is in rare form directing this movie that doesn't have a dull moment.mr. spielberg has found a perfect actor to fill the shoes of the con man with the perfect casting of leonardo dicaprio. it's very easy to see why all the women fall prey of this charmer. he was a fast talker and a slick operator. he exudes charisma to fill another couple of movies.
it's a welcome sight to have mr. dicaprio working in a vehicle that shows his talent as frank abagnale  a man of many faces. he plays a game of hide-and-seek throughout the movie with hanratty  the fbi agent that is in his trail. tom hanks shows great assurance and gusto with this character. of course  the dicaprio magnetism dominates the action with the many ironic twists and the miraculous and narrow escapes he pulls with an aplomb that's bewildering to the feds  who are on his tail all the time.the minor roles are equally important. christopher walken as the father starts out as the prototype of the con man  but he's too decent to do wrong; his business fails eventually. his marriage to natalie baye  the fine french actress  ends in divorce because obviously she hates being married to a loser.the action doesn't stop for one moment. this film is great fun to watch with the winning combination mr. spielberg assured hand gives us this time out. mr. spielberg can thank the genial mr. dicaprio who responds obviously to his direction and makes this con man endearing even when he is committing crimes."
'amores perros' is a shocking experience from visionary director alejandro gonzalez iñarritu. it's a difficult film to watch  one which continuously challenges its audience  but a reward in of itself for those who can withstand its brutality. it puts a magnifying glass to the pain of love  and those who are destroyed by it. it gives new meaning to the film title's literal translation  'love is a bitch'.in a single moment in time  several lives in mexico city will be changed forever by a devastating car crash. the film divides itself into three separate segments: representing the past  present  and future. octavio is searching for recognition and love  but looks in the wrong places. it's a desire that drives him  leading him to make choices in life that will soon haunt him. valerie  whose life is most impacted by the car accident  finds herself living in a relationship that's crumbling and self-destructing. el chivo must deal with the absence of his daughter  and the void it's left in his life. he finds companionship in the dogs he picks up off the street  and they soon become the only living things he can connect with. together  the lives of these individuals will collide in more ways than one. they will find themselves connected by a single thread: love. and the hell that can be unleashed with it.when i finished watching 'amores perros'  one of the first things that popped into my mind was why 'babel' couldn't have been this good. where 'babel' lacked in emotional depths and highs  'amores perros' at times finds itself drowning in it. it's a visceral and gritty film  so raw and intense. you may think you've seen it all  but 'perros' will challenge even those who are rarely phased by cinema. you may find it difficult not to look away at times. iñarritu's movie has been described as being a 'dog holocaust'  and at times i can't disagree. the film's sheer violence is so penetrating and disturbing  it packs a mighty punch. and while this film is definitely not for the squeamish or faint of heart  there's no question that 'amores perros' has a tender heart and message ready to be heard. iñarritu crafts a compelling story from start to finish  which strips down to the bare basics. his ability to capture a piece of the human spirit is wondrous  even if it doesn't always cast us in the best light. it's dark  fierce  and relentless  but nothing short of greatness.'amores perros' features an array of actors and actresses  all of which work wonders in their respective roles. gael garcia bernal is  as always  brilliant. it's a more restrained and less quirky role than many are used to seeing him in  but nonetheless has the rare ability to capture and audience's attention with ease. emilio echevarria stars as el chivo  and delivers a haunting performance as a man who finds himself alone and saddened. it's the weakest part of the film  but is made up for by emilio's wonderful presence. goya toledo plays valerie  a celebrity crippled by the accident the film revolves around. i found her part in the story to be most interesting  if not for the fact of seeing the life of someone who goes from having it all to nothing at all. there are many numerous performances  too many to cover  but they all lend their talents to create something extraordinary.'amores perros' is an adrenaline rush for its entire running  which tops two-and-a-half hours. it's all a very human and primal film  which can be attributed to iñarritu's impeccable style and talent. combining a mutli-faceted story with electric performances  'perros' works on many different layers to satisfying results. an original and bold step in film-making  this nearly perfect picture will have you experience a collage of emotions  and invest in flawed characters... all for the sake of love.
"this mexican movie was surprisingly good. i confess the sin of prejudice concerning mexican cinema  this being maybe the second mexican film i have ever seen  but here my sins are punished. this is the work of a director of big talent. hopefully  he will not be spoiled by the success.
three different stories in today's mexico mix with very few common elements. the characters belong to different social categories  and nothing connects them at first sight  excepting the feeling of un-happiness  and - yes - dogs. dogs play an important role in all three stories. one more warning - there is a lot of cruelty including dog fights - this film is certainly not for sensitive animal lovers. directing is excellent  the stories are human and complex and despite their melodramatic or sometimes tragic outcome  they still leave you with a shade of hope - maybe because the humanity that the author uses to create his characters. there are so many memorable scenes  that i would commit another sin to pick any and describe it here - just rent  or go to watch this movie in the theater - it is worth all 150 or so minutes you will spend. 9/10 on my personal scale."
"...but i had to watch this one again  right afterward  because i needed to go back and watch for clues. honestly  and i won't give away the 'ah ha!' moment  but i knew that he was... well  you know  what he was. what i didn't get was how that was possible  or how the interaction with the others that i saw... so i had to go back and watch the movie again  just to make sure there were no errors in the filming of it. sure enough  i found none that i could call an error  and was totally blown away with how this was filmed. i am a writer  and i also adapt novels for scripts  and when something like this comes along  that something that just totally grabs me and says  ""this is something special... this is not the ordinary..."" well  i am impressed. i aspire to write something that can really ah ha! someone in this way. i recommend the movie  highly."
"the surprise ending to ""the sixth sense"" has gotten so much attention that it threatens to overshadow the film. i occasionally hear people say things like the following: ""the 'twist' was so obvious that i figured it out in the first five minutes!"" some of those people may even be telling the truth. there's no way to know. but there's a lot of condescension in such remarks  an implication that anyone who didn't figure it out must be a really dumb sucker. at least in my case i have an excuse. when i first saw this film back in early 2000  i knew nothing about it other than that it was about the relationship between a psychiatrist played by bruce willis and a child with some sort of psychic power. i didn't even know what that psychic power was  and an early scene led me to think it was telepathy. in short  i had no idea even what the movie's subject was until about the middle of the film  so i was completely adrift as to solving the movie's mystery.still  to anyone who did figure the secret out quickly  i have this to say: you may be smarter than i am  but that does not make this a bad movie. hitchcock went to great lengths to keep the ending to ""psycho"" from leaking out. many people who watch that film today figure the twist out (probably because it has been imitated in countless thrillers since then)  but the film is still a classic that holds up well today. surprise endings are  ultimately  just clever contrivances  extra layerings on the cake. they do not constitute the difference between a good movie and a bad movie. a movie must work on its own terms before springing a surprise.nevertheless  there can be no denying that the twist in ""the sixth sense"" is particularly clever. it's no virtue if a twist is impossible to predict. it is just as important that the twist be logical as that it be surprising. plenty of thrillers feature twists that are arbitrary  where the plot fails to provide enough hints. even a clever thriller like ""fight club"" requires a bit of a stretch to accept the ending. what makes ""the sixth sense"" impressive is that it never cheats by suggesting that earlier scenes were imaginary. everything we see is real  and only our assumptions fool us. if  however  you weren't fooled  all the better: just because you figure out the magician's trick does not make it a bad trick.consider what appears to be happening in the film. willis plays a psychiatrist who has received accolades for helping children with problems. we see a romantic evening with him and his wife at home. then he gets into an ugly  violent confrontation with a former patient. willis believes he has failed  and he wants to make amends by helping a new child (haley joel osment) who appears to be having the same problems (and perhaps the same abilities) that his former patient once displayed. but just as he thinks he's making progress with osment  his marriage seems to be falling apart. his wife isn't talking to him  and is beginning to see another man.however these events may be reinterpreted by what is revealed later  the movie is effective because it works on this basic level. in a key scene  willis asks osment what he wants most  and osment answers  ""i don't want to be scared anymore."" it is not always clear that osment is really facing a mortal threat. but because the movie establishes that he is undergoing a scary experience  by the time the movie reveals what it is that is frightening him  we have our emotions invested in the character  and the terror is very real to us. this is a step that most horror films neglect  the recognition that the most powerful fear may be the fear of fear itself.when i was a teenager  i assumed that all good horror films had to have an r rating. even as an adult  i was surprised that a movie as frightening as ""the sixth sense"" received only a pg-13. in hindsight  however  most of my favorite horror films  whatever their rating  have relatively little violence. like all good horror films  ""the sixth sense"" allows the suspense to build and does not rely on either excessive violence or cheap scares. the ending adds an additional level of intrigue  but it is not necessary to one's enjoyment during the first viewing. still  if you have not seen the film by now and remain woefully ignorant of the surprise lurking in its plot  i urge you  before someone ruins it for you  go and watch the movie!"
i loved this movie. everything about it. it is one you just want to watch over and over again. jim carey  as usually  played an amazing role. he made you think you were him  as the whole movie did. watch it... its a must.imagine being captivated all your life in a show  without knowing. your neighbors  your family  your loved ones... everyone you ever knew were just actors  pretending to be people they are not. well truman burbank not only imagined it  but also lived it. this is a hilarious movie  that will catch you from the first minute you watch it. just be aware... once you start watching it  it will be difficult to stop. i rate this movie 5/5  with no negative comments.
"'the truman show' epitomizes strong and original storytelling on screen. this film is emotionally engaging  didactic  witty  dramatic and very unique. for those unfamiliar with the concept  truman burbank has never left his ideal home town of sea haven. what he doesn't know is that his entire environment is a materialized set and he is the ignorant star of a reality tv show of epic proportions.taking this entirely original concept  writer andrew niccol and director peter wier take the viewer into territory uncharted by anything in film history. thus  the plot is entirely unpredictable but still flows along expertly. the tightness of the screenplay and the immaculate pacing of peter wier contribute largely to this film's brilliance.the acting performances are amongst the best i've ever seen. jim carey is superb as truman  effortlessly conveying his fears  desires and personality. ed harris is excellent as the reclusive creator of the production. in addition  the entire support cast appears synthetic enough to let the audience know they are ""acting"" for truman but in some scenes let their ""genuine"" feelings shine through. the ensemble simply cannot be faulted. carey was hardly done by not to get an oscar nomination for his performance.the music and visuals are top notch. the cinematography has a reality tv feel that is clever but never intrusive. the shot selection is of the highest quality  particularly in the movie's final sequence. muscially  this film is incredible. phillip glass is a dream on the piano  perfectly evoking the mood for each section of the narrative. the two combine excellently during the scene in which truman breaks his routine for the first time. during the sequence  truman makes subtle changes to the bland routine he follows compliantly every day. the emotion of the music when combined with the apparent simplicity of truman's actions makes this scene one the most powerful i'v ever experienced.this film is an absolute gem. it effortlessly combines everything a classic film should have. it has comedy  drama  strong character development  atmosphere  originality  superb visuals  a superb score  tight writing  raises interesting moral questions as well as providing insight into the human condition. one cannot watch this spectacular film without wondering how a human would react when put in that kind of situation. it touches on our sense of adventure  desire for conformity and the courage we require to question the life we are presented with. 'the truman show' does all this in the most accessible and compelling fashion. one of the greatest films of our time."
i'd heard a lot of bad press about this movie. not as good as fargo  was a much used phrase. i wasn't overly impressed with fargo  the atmosphere just didn't click for me  but anyway  that made me a little apprehensive about this.it's easily better than fargo  imho  and it's right up there with barton fink or miller's crossing. a true comedy classic with so many memorable lines and characters  but it's the movie's atmosphere which is so truly joyous  a wonderful celebration of basically doing nothing. achieving one's goals is important  yes  but it's okay to set them low  is what i perceived this movie to be saying. as long as one is basically a good guy  then that's enough. well  that's what it seemed like to me  and it was expressed so beautifully in the stunning cast of grotesques  lovely music ( although more burwell would have been nice )  and the trippiest  funniest  most absurd dream sequences you've ever seen. great stuff.
"it's actually kind of hard to describe this movie (and what's so great about it) to people who don't already know it and love it; as with many cult films  the big lebowski will either speak to you (in which case you will become a fervent follower of his dudeness and abide by his code for the rest of your life) or  if it doesn't  the film will either leave you completely indifferent or you'll even downright hate it.i believe it's a very funny film and i'm sure it can be rightfully called a comedy  but don't expect punchlines  gags  jokes or slapstick - it's not that kind of comedy. if you want to enjoy this film  you have to meet jeffery ""the dude"" lebowski on his terms  hang out with him and his bowling buddies and follow them at a their (perhaps somewhat leisurely) pace through this weird and unbelievable tale about nihilism  theft (of a car and  more importantly: a creedence clearwater revival tape)  kidnapping  abstract art  porn and - of course - bowling. the story is actually kind of simple. you see  some no-good german nihilists urinated on the dude's rug - and this kind of aggression just won't stand against the dude. with the help of his bowling buddies  he will do everything in his power to get someone to pay for his rug - or possibly get a new one (because that rug really tied the room together). so he embarks on this worthy quest during which he will encounter many wondrous things and fascinating people (even jesus - who is not the messiah but a very naughty man).with jeff bridges in the leading role  the coen brothers have found the perfect actor to incorporate one of the most iconic characters that has ever been created. but it's not just the dude that makes this a winner; the whole film is such an inspired folly and simply inventive filmmaking at its finest (the hilarious dream sequence alone is worth the price of admission). the supporting cast is outstanding (j.turturro  j.goodman and s.buscemi among many others)  the song choices are perfect and the dialog is the funniest  most quotable in any comedy i've ever seen. this - for me - is without a doubt the film with the highest rewatchability factor of all time. 10 stars out of 10.favorite films: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054200841/lesser-known masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/favorite low-budget and b-movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/"
wong kar-wai's elegant study of the love between two lonely neighbours is a rare masterpiece of beauty and subtlety that will reward the close attention of any viewer willing to absorb the quietly defining moments of its character's lives and prepared to forsake today's seemingly pre-conditioned requirement for a story to be laid out for them like a menu. it is an intimate story  told with care at a deliberate pace  that captures with exquisite beauty both the depth of emotion shared by the main characters and the social constraints and sense of propriety that apparently precludes them from consummating their love.chow (tony leung) and chan (maggie cheung) move into single rooms in adjacent apartments on the same day in 1962 hong kong. chan's husband spends weeks at a time away from home on business while chow's wife proves to be equally elusive. over time  it becomes apparent to both of them that their spouses are engaged in an affair with each other  a realisation that draws them together and signals the beginning of a deep relationship.wong kar-wai has fashioned a story that is as beautiful as it is enigmatic. almost everything is hinted at here  requiring a high degree of concentration from the viewer if they are to be rewarded with any kind of insight into the both the sexual and sociological elements with which the protagonists struggle and the irretrievable sense of loss that is the reward of those who lack the strength and courage of their emotions. the adulterous spouses are never seen on the screen  this isn't their story; they are merely the catalysts for the one we are shown  and the manner in which chow and chan uncover their infidelity is typical of the subtlety with which wong kar-wai tells his story. we watch the emotions flickering beneath the surface of chan's carefully composed face as she offers medicine to chow's wife  knowing  before we do  that she has interrupted her illicit liaison with her own husband. next shot: chow's fist knocking on her door  wedding ring prominent  their wedding rings  symbols here of love  infidelity  and the guilt that separates them  are often prominent  while chan cries in the shower. a couple of scenes later  the deceit is confirmed when both chan and chow realise their spouses have identical possessions that can only be bought overseas.the mood is almost noirish at times  and the film is suffused with lush colours and patterns. wong kar-wai repeatedly obscures our view  whether through dusty windows  or through skilfully composed framings designed to emphasise the sense of confinement within the teeming  over-populated city of hong kong. many times  a wall takes up half (or more) of the screen. wong also makes effective use of slow-motion to evoke the impression of loneliness and richly-textured memories  such as the moment early in the film when chow and chan  before their friendship develops  share a brief glance in the front room of her landlady in which a mahjong game is taking place. leung and cheung are perfect together  conveying their sense of guilt and frustration in performances that rely more on nuance than they do on words  it's the type of acting that only the most accomplished can pull off  and both leung and cheung do so admirably.in the mood for love is a film about loneliness in a crowded place  about the bitterness of regret  and its story is told in an intelligent and seductive manner that leaves the viewer astounded by the director's seemingly innate sense of visual imagery and ability to deliver a film of highly-charged emotion in a restrained manner that reflects superbly the internal struggle of its protagonists. anyone who considers themselves to be a true movie lover should make an effort to see this movie.
"i think that new york times film critic elvis mitchell wrote the best one line review of in the mood for love when he said that it is ""dizzy with a romantic spirit that's been missing from the cinema forever."" how true those words are! truly romantic films are so rare these days  while films that include plenty of sex and nudity (which are often portrayed in a smutty and gratuitous manner) abound. so  given this cinematic climate  wong kar-wai's latest film feels like a much needed breath of fresh air. in the mood for love is about the doomed romance between two neighbors (""mr. chow "" played by tony leung and ""mrs. chan "" played by maggie cheung)  whose spouses are having an illicit affair  as they try ""not to be like them."" but after hanging out with each other on lonely nights (while their spouses are away ""on business""/""taking care of a sick mother"")  they fall madly in love  and must resist the temptation of going too far.several factors are responsible for making in the mood for love a new classic among ""romantic melodramas "" in the best sense of that term. first  the specific period of the film (i.e. 1960's hong kong) is faithfully recreated to an astonishing degree of detail. the clothes (including maggie cheung's lovely dresses)  the music (e.g. nat king cole)  and the overall atmosphere of this film evokes a nostalgia for that specific period. second  christopher doyle's award-winning  breathtakingly beautiful cinematography creates an environment which not only envelopes its two main characters  but seems to ooze with romantic longing in every one of its sumptuous  meticulously composed frame. make no mistake about it: in the mood for love was the most gorgeous film of 2001. (it should also be mentioned that wong kar-wai's usual hyper-kinetic visual style is (understandably) toned down for this film  although his pallet remain just as colorful.) third  there is the haunting score by michael galasso  which is accompanied by slow motion sequences of  e.g. chan walking in her elegant dresses  chan and chow ""glancing"" at each other as they pass one another on the stairs  and other beautiful scenes which etch themselves into one's memory. the main score--which makes its instruments sound as though they're literally crying--is heard eight times throughout various points in the film and it serves to highlight the sadness and the longing which the two main characters feel. fourth  tony leung and maggie cheung both deliver wonderful performances (leung won the prize for best actor at cannes) and they manage to generate real chemistry on screen.the above elements coalesce and work so nicely together to create a film that feels timeless  ""dizzyingly romantic "" and  in a word  magical. in the mood for love  perhaps more than any other film of 2001  reminded me why it is that i love ""going to the movies."" and i guess that is about the highest compliment that i can pay to a film."
"trainspotting is the best movie i've ever seen!  danny boyle did a excellent job of directing a movie based on irvine welsh's bestselling novel about desperate and hopeless scottish heroin addicts.  and all the cast did a superb job acting some of the most outrageous and offensive characters i've ever seen.  the only downside of this movie is understanding those thick scottish accents  but that also adds a bit of humor to the movie.
what i liked best about trainspotting was the characters.  they were the most unbelievable low-life  junky  sleazy  immoral  trash i've ever seen. i loved it! they'll make you both despise and pity them while loving them at the same time.and the plot (which can be credited to irvine welsh) was unbelievable. although some of the shocking elements this movie had distracted me from the story at first  repeated viewings of it made me appreciate it as one of the most profound stories ever."
"after reading some of the reviews that trash this film i had to speak up.this film is gritty and dirty. there is content which is not pleasant  swearing and violence amounts other things. what else would you expect a film about drug addiction to be about? well more than that actually  it about choices and what you choose! never at any point did this film make drugs look at all appealing to me in any way  i never did understand why so many people thought that it did. at no point did it ever say ""look at this  its cool."" for those who think the level of swearing in this film is too much then they clearly haven't spent any time with working class people in britain  not just scotland. i being one of them can say its fairly accurate in that account.that being said  those things do not take anything away from the film  the quality of plot and story  or the acting which is stunning! robert carlise as begbe was excellent  and ewan macgregor shined. also the character spud was worth a mention he really was quite good.this film is in my opinion a work of genius  that represents the book accurately."
the eternal conflict between good and evil is played out here against the backdrop of a bitter cold american landscape. a group of quirky  ruthless criminals eventually find themselves pursued by a very pregnant cop and her unassuming colleagues. with the coen brothers at the helm  the audience gets equal doses of humor and violence - often simultaneously - and finally feels awestruck by the simple goodness of marge and her sweet-tempered husband. this is the movie that should have won the oscar in '97 but lost to the english patient which had lots of snob appeal  the one thing fargo lacked - for sure. it would take years for the academy to make up for their error by awarding the statuette to the coen's no country for old men  one of the rare times when the best picture winner actually was the year's best picture. fargo may have lost that year  but one thing it did win was the gratitude of many film-goers for the gift of a wonderfully entertaining crime movie.
"""what'd this guy look like anyway?""  ""oh  he was a little guy  kinda funny lookin'.""  ""uh-huh. in what way?""  ""just a general way.""  in that interplay between a brainerd  mn.  police officer and a witness  discussing a criminal investigation  you have one of your principal  pieces of dialogue from what is considered by many to be joel and ethan  coen's finest film.  of course you can draw comparisons to others they've made  such as  blood simple  raising arizona  even barton fink and the big lebowski.  but fargo illustrates the coen brothers' takes on plot  art and drama  more succinctly and emotionally than any of those others. here you have  a set of memorable  if not always likable  characters in a plot that  goes from clunky to chaotic in the most unspoiled manner  from jerry  lundegaard's stilted conversation with gaear and carl in a bar in fargo  at the beginning of the movie - the only occasion in which the movie  specifically shows you fargo  n.d. - to marge gunderson's confrontation  with gaear and the wood-chipper.  frances mcdormand deservedly won an oscar for playing a well-balanced   intelligent  pregnant police officer placing her own straightforward  methodology on to an investigation of bizarre goings-on. and william h.  macy gives a true one-two punch playing a frenetically-charged  fearful  and  in the end  inept used car salesman trying in the most remarkable  manner to make money. the two best scenes in the movie are the two  occasions in which marge questions jerry about the brainerd murders and  a car from his lot being involved -- i couldn't imagine an actress  doing a better job of seriously but comically exclaiming  ""he's fleeing  the interview!""  notable among the actors as well are steve buscemi and peter stormare  playing carl and gaear  the two hit men hired by jerry to help him con  his father-in-law out of money. there's comic brilliance watching  stormare silently grimace at buscemi's violent but gregarious behavior   and buscemi shines being able to play the most out-of-control of all  the characters in the movie. kristin rudrüd also stands out playing  jean lundegaard  jerry's haplessly kidnapped wife.  if you can appreciate an intelligent look at not-always-so-intelligent  life on this planet  you'll enjoy the little more than the hour and a  half this movie has to show you."
this film is in my top 3! it is that simple... i have seen this movie over and over again  because it's just that good. the 3 characters (vinz  saïd and hubert)act superb. even tough the movie is in black and white  it enhanced the movie. the main story of the film is just great  a real sub-urban style. furthermore it is a very powerful non-hollywood film and that is an extra bonus. watch this movie and you'r hooked for life haha :).the ending is so powerful that you think: this movie is just to good to be true.i know my comment isn't very helpfull  but i wanted to give you all my opinion about the film.
'mean streets' in french - and so much more. while there are so many references to scorsese that you could almost call it an homage  this french milestone deals with the disillusioned youth who live in the outskirts of paris in such an elegant - and honest - way  that i would go so far as to call it the most relevant french film of the last 20 years. but it's also a cinematic masterpiece and great  often hilarious entertainment. everything fits: the musical choices  the outstanding performances by the 3 main characters  the beautiful cinematography and flawless direction. and  perhaps most of all  the perfect script. as much a realistic portrayal of a torn society as it is an artistic achievement  'la haine' is essential viewing.my vote: 10 out of 10favorite films: http://www.imdb.com/list/mkjokvqlsbs/lesser-known masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/favorite low-budget and b-movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/favorite tv-shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/
"before sunrise has many remarkable things going on  almost too many to fit into one review like this  but it's suffice to say that it's one of the most observant character studies of the nineties  maybe even in all of contemporary cinema  to be observant not about love  per-say  so much as it's about a human connection. how does one fall in love at first sight? no one does  at least that's deep down the consensus that linklater wants to show with his film. and *yet* there is the possibility of as intense a connection  of a bond that can form in those that are young and with many ideas that can be expressed articulately and with a breadth of cynicism and is somehow very tender and true at the same time. linklater here gives us the story of celine and jessie  a french girl and an american boy who get off the same train heading to vienna  and on the way there start to talking about things  at first arbitrary  then personal (jessie seeing death for the first time in his great grandfather). jessie persuades celine to go along with him on a night out on the 'town'  in vienna  until his plane the next morning.before sunrise gives jessie and celine  in the midst of the gorgeous vienna scenery and locales to go on and on about subjects that have a lot of importance  and in a sense is about the act of having conversations  of what it's like to watch people having one leading into another and another. here it's often about relationships and commitments  as jessie and celine tell stories sometimes somewhat inconsequential  or seemingly so  and another that may tell a lot about their essential qualities. we hear confessions of desires for other loves  or what weren't really loves  of being part of a family or part of an upbringing that may or may not inform how you'll love your life  of what it means to believe or not believe in some religious form  or just to have some connection to any faith and the soul (i loved the bit about the quakers in the church)  and sometimes laced with cynicism or skepticism. jessie may be more responsible for that last part  but what's fascinating about the film is that it's never exactly cynical itself  just commenting upon cynicism that lays in the concerns of men and women at that age of their lives.meanwhile  it's always great to see ethan hawke and julie delpy in these roles  where they're not incessantly annoying in that 90s generation-x mode  but are the kinds of people where if not in the central conceit of the film  which isn't a bad one at all but a necessary one  one might think to find walking along the streets of a city somewhere. the conceit is that of an old romantic picture ala brief encounter  only here intimacy is expressed in the central characters either between each other  where sweet asides are actually acceptable (""i have to tell you a secret""  jessie says  and then leans in for a kiss  ho-ho)  or in the little moments that pop up with other people along the way. i loved the scene with the poet  where it's very cinematic a thing to suddenly find a random romantic bit player in the midst of a romantic picture with such beautiful words at his disposal  or with the palm reader and how the reactions from jessie and celine are that we might share  but really are seeing them do it first-hand. all the while hawke and delpy embody the roles interestingly- we can see how neuroses are being formed already for their adult lives- as it may lead off into the future...featuring splendid cinematography and a script with an ear for natural wit and a true sense of what it means to have a moment of happiness  however self-contained  as it may lead into something more. who's to say you can't suddenly be attached to someone  if only for less than 24 hours  and be that much more attached than a married couple? this is perhaps linklater's thesis  but there's more to it than just that. it's a very dense film  and one that will have me calling back to it repeatedly. one scene especially  which is both cheesy and brilliant is when the two of them are talking 'on the phone' in front of each other mimicking their expositions might go to the other's friend. a+"
what an incredibly brave and honest look at relationships. i've have never seen a film so precisely and brilliantly capture this kind of emotion and transfer it to the screen the way before sunrise does. what a crime that neither ethan hawke or julie delpy was nominated for any major acting awards  actually screw that! what a crime it was that they didn't both sweep every major acting award altogether and that richard linklater didn't get any recognition for the screenwriting or brilliant directing of his wonderful actors! loved the ending (as much as it pained me at the same time)  loved how after it all they go back and show every location that the couple shared together. loved how the dialogue never wavers  never addressing the relationship directly but allows us to indirectly see a geniune bond forming through the body language  facial expressions  and the dialogue  ooooohhh the dialogue. every bit of it plucked right from those top ten late night conversations we've all had with close friends whether it was serious or in jest. and respect to linklater for keepin it real  the movie was rated r cause of a couple minor swear words? could of easily been removed without really desecrating the film but he keeps it in anyways. screw you hollywood  your 'romantic comedies'  your freddie prinze jr.'s  your 'take the glasses off the girl and now she's pretty' movies. this is real romance! this is what i come to the movies for  to think  to be provoked and to be swept away by the magic that only cinema can provide. before sunrise has single-handedly reminded me about why i goto the movies......
spoilers herein.in addition - or perhaps in spite of - what you have heard  this trilogy is organized around the three main choices one can take in narrative stance. `blue` was about the past  `white` about the `conditional' future(s) and this one about the present. or rather about a couple instances of the present that overlap: is their really only one judge  one lost love  one dead battery  one hooked brother?the folding of the present uses the folding mechanism of watching: us as watchers  much of the world watching valentine through cameras  runways  teevee. the judge-with- qualms monitoring. and all of these folded against the others.and on top of it  kieslowski has assembled a design team that produces one of the lushest visions on film  taking the folding metaphor into the framing  especially in the various rooms.if you know what he is attempting here: three essays on the role of the viewer in creating the `time' of the film world  it makes all three that much richer. but here we have his most sublime success  a perfect synthesis that people can enjoy even if they know not why. and that's the point  isn't it?oh  and each of the trilogy focuses on a sense: here  it is sound.ted's evaluation -- 4 of 3: every cineliterate person should experience this.
"the last film in the three colors trilogy  red  is deceptively simple  yet it rounds out everything that came before in an enlightening way. it slightly resembles the double life of veronique in its theme of fraternity  and in its casting of irene jacob  who manages to exude a sense of curious innocence and integrity. she interprets the role of valentine  a young swiss model and student living in geneva and experiencing a kind of emotional limbo as she awaits her boyfriend's return from england. through a seemingly trivial twist of fate  she  encounters a cynical retired judge (jean-louis trintignant) who leads a lonely  world weary existence and eavesdrops on his neighbors' telephone conversations. initially she finds his detached indifference appalling  and wants to report him  but her compassionate nature enables her to comprehend the greater plight of the man  one of leading a fruitless  lovelorn life. they form a touching friendship  and this sets the stage for another turn of events. auguste (jean-pierre lorit) is young judge who is in many ways a mirror image of trintignant's character. he lives near valentine  but through possible lack of synchronicity  they never meet. upheavals in his life are accordingly similar to the old judge's  but this time  due to the presence of the noble valentine  an old adversity can be turned on its side  bringing fulfillment for everyone.with red  there is a real sense of culmination unlike any other. wistful  melancholy  yet life-affirming  the film offers hope in world full of supposed mistaken paths. tritignant remarked on kieslowski's talents in augmenting the emotions of the actors through his technique: ""i'm very pleased with my work on this film - and i don't think it had a lot to do with me. for example  at the end of the film when my character goes to the window  looks outside  and starts to cry - i couldn't do it  i couldn't summon the tears. i tried to make myself cry but couldn't manage it. krzysztof called the make-up lady who shot menthol into my eyes. we shot the scene and krzysztof said 'it's good  next shot.' recently i saw the finished film. i waited anxiously for this scene. and i cried when i saw myself.""tritignant's nuanced portrayal is augmented by equally good work from jacob who bears insight into her role as well: ""something really great about red are the 'non-encounters' between auguste and valentine. they pass each other without ever meeting. they might be great for each other but they never meet. it reminds me of the double life of veronique where the two identical veroniques are face to face but don't see each other. in red this idea is reflected by the way valentine can't face up to her life  her love  her sorrows. how can auguste see her  or she him? how can they both release themselves from this blindness?""the uplifting aura of this film shines even brighter given the pettiness with which the academy of motion picture arts and sciences brushed it off. due to the fact that is a multinational co-production  with a polish director  mixed swiss and french cast and crew  red was not allowed to compete for a best foreign language film oscar as a film from switzerland. indeed  the trilogy itself is without a country as it transcends borders and even culture in its solemn inquiry into human nature and that is a prize in itself."
"my first epic movie to see on the big screen was jurassic park. i was only 8 years old and i had no idea what i was in for when i watched this movie. i was terrified but so enchanted by this world. steven spielberg brought back the dinosaur genre  a genre that was only used with caveman movies. not to mention did it with incredible special effects. i remember seeing this movie for the first time and asked my mom if the dinosaurs were real or if they made giant robots. those dinosaurs not only looked real but were absolutely terrifying. but what an adventure we took with jurassic park  the land where anything could happen with a crazy billionaire and upset employees who pretty much destroy the world for a nickel. one of the most memorable movies of all time that still holds up to this day  jurassic park is a film not to be missed.billionaire john hammond  has recently created jurassic park: a theme park populated with dinosaurs cloned from the dna extracted from insects preserved in prehistoric amber. after a park worker is attacked by a dinosaur  hammond's investors  demand that experts visit the park and verify that it is safe. gennaro invites dr. ian malcolm  a mathematician  while hammond invites paleontologist dr. alan grant and paleobotanist dr. ellie sattler. they are joined on the island by hammond's two grandchildren tim and lex. hammond asks malcolm  grant  and sattler what their thoughts are about having recreated dinosaur species. the group sets off to explore the park. the head computer programmer  dennis nedry  is secretly in the employ of one of ingen's corporate rivals  and has been paid to steal fertilized dinosaur embryos. during his theft  nedry deactivates the park's security system  allowing him access to the embryo storage. the group is now parked in front of the t-rex's cage and now they are fighting for their lives in jurassic park.i think one of the most memorable scenes is definitely the raptors chasing the children in the kitchen. what a tense scene that made you hold your breath the whole way through. you have to love jeff goldblum in this movie  when he tries to ""save"" the children from the t-rex and instead pretty much gets his butt kicked  he gets saved later and as they are chased in the car by the t-rex the only thing he can say as this giant monster is catching up faster and faster with each footstep  he says ""must go faster"" so calmly  how funny! but there is a moment that scares me more than the dinosaurs that i'm surprised no one noticed in the editing room  the granddaughter is scared to death screaming at sam neill that the lawyer left them and he replies with a dark look ""that's not what i'm going to do"". i responded that with ""i have much darker plans for you""  i mean his look was just so creepy! i digress  jurassic park is still a very fun movie that is the ultimate adventure. it's timeless and i can't wait to show my kids one day  what a great movie with wonderful effects and a wonderful cast and crew.9/10"
jurassic park is a 1993 american science fiction adventure film directed by steven spielberg. it is the first installment of the jurassic park film series. it is based on the 1990 novel of the same name by michael crichton  with a screenplay written by crichton and david koepp. the film centers on the fictional isla nublar  an islet located off central america's pacific coast  near costa rica  where a billionaire philanthropist and a small team of genetic scientists have created a wildlife park of cloned dinosaurs.jurassic park is the second steven's spielberg classic cult film. a great science fiction/action/adventure film. this film is great edge of your seat action sequences. it has a wonderful cast with wonderful performance of their characters. john williams music score is excellent the same like is in indiana jones films. beside raiders of the lost ark is the second best classic movie in the franchise. jurassic park (1993) was nominated for 3 academy awards for best sound  best effects  sound effects editing and visual effects.i love this film to death! it is been 22.years since we got this awesome adventure dinosaurs flick. i know a couple of friends of mine that love this film including me. it is a cult classic film and it has a heart. we have tyrannosaurus rex chasing the group  velociraptors chasing tim and lex after they are reaching the visitor center and they are in inside the main kitchen. dilophosaurus killing nerdy. we also have triceratops in it and brachiosaurus. they are other dinosaurs used in the film: gallimimus  parasaurolophus and alamosaurus they both had a cameo scene in it.the special effects creating the dinosaurs by stan winston are fantastic! the dinosaurs were created with groundbreaking computer-generated imagery by industrial light & magic and with life-sized animatronic dinosaurs built by stan winston's team. to showcase the film's sound design  which included a mixture of various animal noises for the dinosaur roars  spielberg invested in the creation of dts  a company specializing in digital surround sound formats. stan winston and his team did a great job animating live dinosaurs on a screen. steven spielberg did a wonderful job directing this film  it is definitely my second best childhood film from steven spielberg. the first best film would be raiders of the lost ark (1981) which i love this film to death. the screen play written by michael crichton and david koepp did a great job and the plot of the film was just awesome.the plot: during a preview tour  a theme park suffers a major power breakdown that allows its cloned dinosaur exhibits to run amok.the crew cast all did a wonderful job of acting. the acting of this film was terrific and believable.sam neill as dr. alan grant  a leading paleontologist did a wonderful job portraying his character. he act the character like he was written on his skin. laura dern as dr. ellie sattler  a paleobotanist. did a wonderful job like how she cared about an ill triceratops. i was really surprised how the character cares about an ill dinosaurs that she barely know and she wanted to help him was out stating! laura dern for me in this film was a heart and a key watching this film of how a good hearted person she is. jeff goldblum as dr. ian malcolm  a mathematician and chaos theorist was really good in his acting and his character. richard attenborough as john hammond  ingen's billionaire ceo and the park's creator was awesome playing his character. it is really a shame richard attenborough died last year and he isn't with us anymore. ariana richards and joseph mazzello as lex and tim did a wonderful job portraying john hammonds grand children. i didn't know samuel l. jackson was in this film i really didn't know that. the whole cast was awesome in here.music by score by john williams is fabulous and fantastic i always love this song to death.there is everything in this film i love. how dr. grant  lex and tim are fighting to survive when they are trapped alone in the park. how tough and strong they are they don't panic and screaming they are fighting to come back save home. lex and tim are cornered by a pair of raptors inside the main kitchen. in one of the most terrifying scenes in the entire film  the raptors stalk through the dark kitchen  searching for the kids. eventually  lex and tim manage to lure one of the raptors into the freezer and lock it in  but the other raptor chases them out of the kitchen. the scene was the most memorable to me and terrifying. another terrifying scene is when ellie discovers ray's severed arm in the maintenance shed and she sees the raptor that eat ray try's to eat her  that also scared me a lot. after the power was cut off on the electric fences and the kids with alan are climbing over the fences and the power is turn back on by ellie and ray the fence electrifies tim and he fly's down off the fence. the scene was awesome but also terrifying and real.i'm not sure what else you would want in a movie like this?! it is a perfect 10. i love this film to death! i love this film to death!! the action sequences are also awesome  the plot  the cast everything is great about this film.
"i do not see this film as being political nonsense at all.rather it serves as a warning of what can happen when blanket stereotyping is allowed to influence the course of justice.as gareth peirce (impressively portrayed by the excellent emma thompson) points out  the only reason giueseppe conlon and co were tried in the first place was on the shaky premise that ""they were bloody well irish"". as irish people living in england in the 1970s  they must therefore have been terrorists.logical?i thought not.the authorities never thought for a second that they might actually have been trying to escape that nonsense through carving out a new life for themselves in england.with a british public baying for blood  the police capitulated by picking up the first ""paddies"" they found and making an example of them  without making any serious efforts to root out the real perpetrators and ensuring they were rendered incapable of causing more harm through doling out lengthy imprisonments to them  as opposed to ruining the lives of an innocent family.ironically of course such actions could well have served to make terrorist sympathisers out of the conlons through the horrific treatment meted out to them!it didn't of course but there is always the danger in that type of case that a person could become embittered to that extent.obviously given the unstable climate of the time irish people in england were sometimes regarded with suspicion yet the fact remains that the events portrayed in the film were unacceptable in a supposed western democracy committed to the rule of law.while neither side was entirely innocent the fact remains that england was undeniably culpable in this instance  and the judiciary involved in the case must bear full responsibilty for the devestating effects of their knee-jerk ruling  given to appease an irrational and hysterical public.in this respect the conlons and co can viably be seen by some as ""irish martyrs"". while i am no fan of hollywood fare which seeks to glamourise irish terrorists at the expense of england who is invariably portrayed as the cold and unrelenting oppressor (inaccurate and unfair in the present day i feel) i strongly believe that in this case the criticism and negative portrayal of the english legal system is justified to a considerable extent.the film has especial resonance and significance for us today in the wake of al-quaeda and the resultant perceptions of muslims as a whole as being ""the enemy"" in certain quarters.the recent incarceration of an innocent syrian who had lived his entire adult life in canada  and who was imprisoned purely on the basis of his ethnicity  only serves to remind us of the perils of ""judging a book by its cover"" and making snap judgements  a danger which is admirably illustrated in this well-acted film."
"a film fully deserving to be in imdb's top 250  jim sheridan's ""in the name of the father"" is an excellent piece of work. based on a true and very touching story  the film recounts the story of gerry conlon (day-lewis) who is wrongly accused as an ira terrorist. not only are the police bending the facts to prove their case  but in the process they also implicate members of his friends and family  including his father giuseppe (postlethwaithe) whose health condition is rather frail. gerry is a rebellious and mildly delinquent boy who does not seem to have grown up  and his attitude toward his father is not the appropriate one; however  as they start to go through the ordeal together  gerry gradually matures  and starts feeling a deep affection and respect for giuseppe.the story is heart-breaking and shocking at the same time  all the more so when one realizes that these things actually did happen. although there have been some minor modifications for the purpose of the film  the backbone of the story is left completely intact.the two protagonists  daniel day-liewis and pete postlethwaithe are delivering powerful performances  and they both deserved the oscar hands-down. however  it would be unfair not to mention that virtually everyone in the film is great in his/her role.jim sheridan's direction is also very good  giving the plot a fair and balanced perspective; although the film might initially appear as pro-irish / anti-english  in fact i consider it as quite objective. granted  it vividly shows that some key figures in the london police were profoundly biased and manipulated maliciously the case against the conlons; yet  it also shows that english public attitudes turned highly supportive for the conlons' freedom when it started to become clear that they were not the culprits for the atrocities they had been charged with. we have always to remember that the film depicts a period of big tensions  with emotions running high to levels of hysteria  so we have to understand the events within this context.of course  what happened to the conlons is totally deplorable and unjustifiable; and it is real shame that the people who conspired against them have not been punished yet for their crimes. still  one should understand the hostile attitude shown by those who were not part of this conspiracy (such as the judge  for example)  who were influenced by the climate of terror and the outrage of the public. the conlons had the terribly bad luck to be at the wrong place  in the wrong time  and with the wrong nationality; the also have the great misfortune to be captured by people who in their quest to show results were shamelessly willing to risk indicting people who could possibly be innocent.""in the name of the father"" is a fantastic film  which one should not miss. 10/10."
not every thing that's expected from you is your only motive of life. this movie in a great manner teaches us to listen and regard the voice of our soul  the voice of our self.basically the story is about a english literature professor mr. john keating who is a replacement for the previous professor and is conducting his very first class for the school. his idea of teaching is very different and informal  based more on practicality rather than just reading words written in the book. being literature his subject  he inspires his students to weave their own thoughts  he encourages them to use their own imaginations. he clearly believes that everybody has their own personal sense of seeing this world  interpretating things in their own way.the influence of mr. keating on the boys can be judged from their inclining interests towards poetries and proses. they reframe dead poets society which is a kind of club of people reading out poetries among the group. meanwhile  they also learn to listen to their calling. and then series of events goes on and by the end of that  you will be left with tears in your eyes.everything in the movie is so perfectly done. the character of mr. keating played by robin williams is flawless. the smirk on his face puts a different charm and it always keeps you under impression of his control over the situation. also the character of neil played by robin sean leonard keeps you gripped to the emotions that the movie is carrying throughout.this is a kind of movie that will make you think about yourself  your dreams and desires. you will be left with the tears of happiness and a sense of introspection. moreover  if you have interest in writing or have given it a try sometime  this movie is surely going to boost your morale and confidence.
"there are certain films that get under your skin  never to come out. they change your life  subtly altering your perceptions of reality  almost always for the better.dead poets society is one of those few films.i saw the movie back when i was in high school. i had a teacher who told us that we really needed to watch it; in fact  it was our ""homework"" for the day. we didn't need to bring back a report  or talk about it in class. all he asked from us was to watch it  make up our own mind about it  and that was it. as you can imagine  many friends of mine didn't watch it at all; i did. and yes  i feel i changed a bit from there on.back when you are young  you never really stop to think what in the world you are doing with your life. you simply live for the day  hope your grades will be enough to pass  and that's it. long term thinking involves maybe flirting with a girl. nothing more. what this film showed me was that we have the responsability and the joy of being alive in this planet. that we are dust  and we will go back to it  so we have precious little time to make a difference. that we have a moral obligation to ""seize the day  and make our lives extraordinary"" (my favorite quote in all movie history). that the world  basically is ours. that the only limitations are within ourselves  and that we owe it to us to fight  to rebel against conformity  to change what we hate and keep what we love. that living in this world is a beautiful responsability  and that only cowards dare not to change it for the better.the fact that the cast was basically my age  and was passing through the same dilemmas and situations i was facing made it all so much more powerful.so here i sit  12 years from that day. i still don't think i have seized the day completely. but i keep on trying; i always will. i wonder how many people were transformed by this gem of a movie; i hope many.10 out of 10. a definitive masterpiece."
"i didn't have this theory about ""the princess bride"" for years  until i came close to the age of the grandfather that peter falk portrays.here's my theory. the grandfather goes to the bedside of his grandson  portrayed by fred savage  prepared to do what grandfathers do - read him a story. but no  the grandson protests. does it have sports in it? this is a silly ""yucky"" story full of kissing. skip the kissing parts! so the grandfather decides to teach the grandson a lesson (the beginning of my theory). he takes what was probably a straightforward tale of love lost and found again  of giants and evil princes and rescues and magic spells  and embellishes it with the wisdom that can only come from living sixty years on this planet. because  let's face it  the princess bride as we are told has much wisdom in it.what are the chances that a story that has been around for a hundred years has lines such as ""you fell victim to one of the classic blunders - the most famous of which is ""never get involved in a land war in asia"". only somebody who lived through the vietnam war era (the grandfather) would come up with this. too bad dubya wasn't read this book as a child. then there is the bit about the dread pirate roberts - an unseen villain who turns out to be a series of villains. he would tuck wesley into bed each night after he captured him and say ""good night  westley. good work. sleep well. i'll most likely kill you in the morning."" what other sentence so captures the sentiment of working for large corporations these days who will throw you out into the street without a backwards glance? the book hits how people believe something is real or not real based merely on their feelings about it with this zinger as wesley carries the princess through a dangerous swamp. she cautions him about the rous's (rodents of unusual size). wesley's defense - ""i don't think they exist"". one immediately attacks.and finally a great quote about love. an angry prince humperdinck after being rejected by buttercup goes to where wesley is about to be tortured and states ""you truly love each other  and so you might have been truly happy. not one couple in a century has that chance  no matter what the storybooks say."" only after kissing frogs for decades can i say this is so true. and on it goes.thus most of the wisdom of living modern life can be found in this tale within a tale  and i highly recommend it for its humor  its wisdom  and uniqueness. i don't think i've seen anything quite like it."
"i have been waiting for the right time to review this film. i did not feel until today that i was truly ready to say all i had to say about director rob reiner's unforgettable staple of 1980s pop culture. when i first saw the princess bride  i was only 7 years old  and hardly cognizant of film as anything but a pastime. while i remember the movie as being enjoyable  i did not have anywhere near as strong a liking or appreciation for it as i do now. i certainly did not remember the film as a theater-going experience  and recently  i got the chance to view it  on the big screen  with at least fifty others in attendance at a midnight screening.personally  i am one of those people who  by nature  absorbs memorable quotes  and by that token  the entirety of the princess bride is fair game. as i sat there watching  i could always hear somebody  if not more than one person  at least whispering along with the movie under his or her breath. meanwhile  i noticed that there was a wide disparity of age groups. there were pre-teens  teens  people in their twenties  thirties  and some that looked well past forty. if the showing had not been at midnight  i do not doubt that there would have been pre-pre-teens as well.with a screenplay written by william goldman (based on his book)  the princess bride is a classic  familiar story of a princess  her true love  and the forces that come between them. as is evidenced by those in attendance  this is a story for all ages. the manner in which this fairytale part of the story is executed by goldman and reiner is memorable enough to make this a great film. as any fan of the movie will tell you  however  it is the film's whimsical  irreverent  pervasive tongue-in-cheek antics that make it an unqualified masterpiece.if you hang around people who love this film  do not be surprised if they react to unbelievable situations with the exclamation  ""inconceivable!"" likewise  if you tell them to just wait a minute  don't be thrown aback when they suddenly sport a spanish accent in saying  ""i hate waiting."" and if you suddenly  from out of nowhere  hear  ""hello.my name is inigo montoya.you killed my father.prepare to die "" don't worry. it's not your fault  and you're not going to die.while the princess bride has the sort of satirical edge more geared towards adults  the film is equally effective as a pure fairytale  and for this reason  there is a little something for everyone. in addition  the film enacts a self-referential tribute to the power and beauty of fairytale stories  even in the current age in which many consider them archaic and obsolete.a sick grandson (fred savage)  who is spending his time mindlessly playing video games (of the nostalgic atari 8-bit type)  gets a visit from his grandfather (portrayed through a wonderful performance from peter falk). to the grandson's dismay  his elder has brought a book to read to him. when he expresses disapproval at his grandfather's old-fashioned ways  the grandfather's response is  ""when i was your age  television was called books."" even this quote stands out as resonant and memorable.the grandson starts out expressing skepticism and boredom  but of course  as the reading of the story progresses  this gradually gives way to captivation and praise. buttercup (robin wright  in her breakthrough role) is a fair-haired  stunningly gorgeous maiden who has been engaged to the smug  cowardly humperdinck (chris sarandon)  the prince who rules over the land of florin. she of course does not love him  and she has been without joy since her true love  a farm boy named wesley (cary elwes)  was reportedly murdered on the seas.of course  without wesley  there is no story of true love  and we know that he must miraculously return to her someday. this happens through an extraordinary  and increasingly hilarious  set of circumstances. a group of three bandits kidnap buttercup with the intent of killing her to precipitate a war between florin and its enemy  guilder. these three are (in order of increasing stature) the intellectually pompous vizzini (wallace shawn)  the spanish swordsman inigo (mandy patinkin)  and the big-hearted slow-witted giant fezzik (the late andre the giant  in one of the most no-brainer casting decisions in all of film history).during the kidnapping  however  a mysterious man in black closes in on the trail of the three abductors  and it is this man who takes on each of the three one by one in battles of skill  strength  smarts  and of course  deliciously witty repartee. there is something unusually extraordinary about these battles  however.with the exception of vezzini  the abductors are not villains as we might initially perceive them to be. the marvelously choreographed swordplay between the man in black and inigo  and the hilarious absurdity of the handfight with fezzik  are not at all about winning or losing. they embody a sense of honor  sportsmanship  and nobility that is rarely exemplified in competition (both fictional and real).inigo  fezzik  and the man in black do not display their skills pretentiously or flauntingly. instead  they take a strong sense of inner pride in the subtle mastery of their arts. as a result  when we see them engage in competition  there is not a sense of enmity  but a wonderful air of camaraderie.also included in the mix are a sadistic count (christopher guest) with an odd physical characteristic and a penchant for pain  an albino (mel smith) with a stuffy throat  the deadly wrath of an r.o.u.s.  and a clergyman (peter cook) who makes elmer fudd seem eloquently spoken. most memorable  perhaps  is the appearance of billy crystal and carol kane as the miracle-man max and his wife. it has been reported that in the middle of filming this scene  reiner was forced to leave the set  because crystal's improvisations were causing him to laugh to the point of being sick.regarding the film's casting  every single choice  without exception  is absolute perfection. cary elwes not only easily looks the part of a daring  ingenious hero  but as an actor  he has an incredible gift for a subtle mixture of drama and comedy  one that easily coincides with the film's sensibilities. robin wright easily essays the role of the headstrong princess  endlessly devoted to her love (with a convincing british accent  despite her american origins).for the scene of swordplay  elwes and patinkin had to study fencing for months  which is impressive  but on-screen  i had no trouble believing that they were characters who had studied for at least several years. despite his limited acting ability  wrestler andre the giant is perfect for the role of fezzik  and something would be lost with any other actor in his place. and of course  wallace shawn is endlessly amusing to watch as the diminutive  perpetually exasperated vezzini.we also don't have to hear christopher guest and chris sarandon speak any lines to know they are portraying villains. the arrogance  callousness  and sliminess are readily apparent in their facial and bodily expressions.when all is said and done  we have witnessed a wide variety of hilarity  captivating acts of love and heroism  and of course  one of the most satisfying acts of retribution ever put on film (one that immortalizes the film's most famous quote and chooses just the right time and placement for the film's sole swear word).for someone who watches this film for the first time  and quickly catches on to the film's capricious mix of reverence and satire  the film is a marvel to watch simply for the knowledge that you do not know what will come next. will there be a touching moment? a reflective one? an act of bravado? or will our expectations be subverted in an act of comical subterfuge? the answer: any of them will do  as the film has a delectable variety of all of them.from start to finish  the princess bride is a transcendent  magical experience that constantly elicits uproarious laughter and simultaneously immerses the audience in a rich  magnificent  and almost nostalgic world of folklore that  after the end credits roll  seems timeless and undying. in the years since its release in 1987  it has grown into a cult film of legendary status  and judging by the wide variety of ages i witnessed at the screening (as well as the endless barrage of quoting)  it seems perfectly reasonable to assume that the film will endure for many years to come."
"another great 80s film easy way for me to say. do not remake this film it is one of 80s best film's ever made.
vern was one of my favorite kids in the film.
he was awesome i liked how corey played the looney kid. you can't make this movie better so leave it alone."
"i find it hard to comment on this film without simply repeating what has already been said. it's not that i can't think of anything original  but that others seem to have felt the exact same emotions as i did when watching this film.i saw this movie when i was about 12  13  maybe 14 years old. so it didn't have the same nostalgic sense it had for so many. but what it did  was make me ache for those memories. i wanted (in the words of another reviewer) to be 12  and *that* cool. i wished i had been like that  that i had had friends like that  laughed like that  and had adventures like that.the 'milk-money' scene was probably one of my all-time favourite scenes in movie history. up until i saw this movie i had never held much regard for river phoenix  but the poignancy and sincerity which river added to the role of chris chambers touched me to the point of tears. i read in yet another review that in this scene  river was asked to think of a time when he had been hurt by an adult  and that even after the cameras stopped rolling  river sat there still  sobbing and hurting. and i felt every tear and heard every word as though i were there with chris.this movie made me laugh  cry  rejoice and fear with chris  gordie  teddy and vern. i loved the campfire scenes  and today i look back on my own childhood  and remember with a laugh the amazingly similar things i used to laugh and wonder about with my friends. i remember dreaming about being a writer and an actress  i remember standing up to bullies  i remember walking or riding with my friends  i remember being afraid  and crying onto a friend's shoulder.i guess what this movie does for everyone  is take them back in time  even though the situations may have been different  chances are you'll find the similarities  and remember with a smile that yes  your life was once *that* cool. in the words of vern  ""a great time""i especially loved the ending. that they found out who was strong  and who just talked tough. i loved the last scene with chris and gordie  and the closing monologue.""i never had any friends later on  like the ones i had when i was twelve...jesus....does anyone?"""
"""platoon"" was my first introduction to wartime reality.i was just a kid when first viewing it and the film left a powerful impression in me.before that i had only seen a couple of rambo films and thats what i expected to get here pretty much.it turned out to be something quite different from that although it would take me a few years to realize just how different.""platoon"" is oliver stone's breakthrough picture and a landmark in hollywood history of the 80's.it features almost every well known actor on the rise from that era most notable ones being forest whitaker johnny depp willem dafoe francesco quinn and charlie sheen.why is it a landmark film?it helped to bring more understanding into the hot issue of vietnam war although ""apocalypse now!"" had already worked out that subject in the most stunning way.yet there was still something left to say for stone.it was pretty much the same as coppola said but in another more harrowing and less complex way.we got a closer glimpse of how it is to die for one.dafoe's heroic end is one of the most dramatic scenes in history of war films.a strong issue here is the abuse of military codes and discipline.tom berenger's sadistic disturbed sgt. barnes is the perfect example of a warrior playing god or angel of death  and fighting a war by his own rules.berenger plays barnes so well that it really gives you the chills watching him and you want him dead.sgt. elias is his counterpart in every way as he really cares for his men and is in touch with the human in him always.he is not popular among the lowlifes like the redneck psychopath bunny (great early role by kevin dillon) and the spineless racist o'neill in john mcginley's incarnation.another spineless character is the young lieutenant who on one hand is a greater sinner than barnes.he has no control over the men under his command whatsoever and refuses to take responsibility or even feel the guilt for not doing anything to prevent the massacre of the village committed by barnes and his butchers.here we see the effect that the horrors are having on private chris as he in a fit of frustration and anger over the situation he is in tortures a sick and frail creature of a man and ends up in tears.its a powerful and riveting scene which highlights the film's message against war showing its inhumanity and absurdity in the most shocking way.the final battle is very brutal and well shot.it sums up the whole vietnam war and the strategy of the american army.the napalm kills not just the vietcongs but also americans.ironically it saves chris' life as he is about to be killed by barnes during their confrontation.bunny gets what he deserves and junior who is the most despicable of the black characters here also dies.this may be seen as director's own judgment.the only other sympathetic character still alive by this time the underground lord rah  is left alive.francesco quinn shows here that he is capable of taking over his father's legacy.in the end this film is not flawless but it is a perfect document of the madness that occurred in vietnam 1964-73.and its consistent to its very end which by the way is very touching and almost made me cry the second time i watched it.it is funny how one can feel both happy and sad about leaving a war torn place.such are the feelings that a war conjures up in a man.it is almost like chris was sad he was leaving or maybe the emotions that were bubbling under surface just came out for real.any which way this film will always be remembered as the one that gave a true and unpolished picture of mankind at war at a time when hollywood producers made an attempt to glorify the us army and cast an eclipse on its disgraceful stain transforming the killing into culture.ironically they succeeded.8/10"
"platoon is a 1986 american war film written and directed by oliver stone one of the most strongest realistic anti war films of all time. it is one of the best vietnam war films i have ever seen that won the academy award for best picture of 1986 and best director for oliver stone  as well as best sound mixing and best film editing. stone's vietnam film portrayed a real life human been on his point of view of the story telling that went on in his real life that he experienced after his tour of duty in vietnam ended in 1968  oliver stone wrote a screenplay called break: a semi-autobiographical account detailing his experiences and the life he was in vietnam. the characters were portrayed more then a few soldiers they were portrayed more as a human been than been soldiers obeying an order.platoon shows the vietnam war was a big mistake  but being a fictional documentary on vietnam is far from its purpose. it is one of my personal favorite war movies. i love this movie to death. those of us who did make it have an obligation to build again  to teach to others what we know  and to try with what's left of our lives to find a goodness and meaning in this life. in platoon  chris taylor (charlie sheen) is a young  naive u.s. soldier who  upon his arrival to vietnam  quickly discovers that he must do battle not only with the viet cong  but also with the gnawing fear  physical exhaustion and intense anger growing within him. while his two commanding officers draw a fine line between the war they wage against the enemy and the one they fight with each other  the conflict  chaos and hatred permeate taylor  suffocating his realities and numbing his feelings to man's highest value... life.chris sees his platoon fragmented into two halves  each aligned with one of two men -- sgt. elias (willem dafoe) and sgt. barnes (tom berenger). those two soldiers are really two positive good things to see in the film because it sets the viewer on the seat of the edge. they both have nominally the same enemy (viet cong)  but  really  it doesn't take long to realize that elias is good  and barnes is evil (the ""enemy"" does not enter into the moral equation of this film  at all it's an outside threat  same as malaria-carrying mosquitoes or even friendly fire). elias feels the futility of the war and has respect for life; barnes fights the war doggedly and has no compassion  period. both are efficient soldiers fighting the same enemy  but really as is at one point aptly put by chris taylor himself they are fighting for the souls of the platoon members  as the outcome of the war is never really in doubt.the platoon reaches the village  where a food and weapons cache is discovered. while questioning the village chief  barnes loses his patience and senselessly kills the man's wife despite his denials that they are aiding the viet cong. barnes is about to murder the man's young daughter to force him to tell them to where the enemy is. elias doesn't take kindly to this kind of behavior. elias and barnes come closer and closer to open conflict  as taylor becomes a veteran  obviously siding with elias. meanwhile  the fate of the platoon comes closer and closer to them  culminating in an explosively shot action conclusion. the end is dark  but morally satisfying.platoon is a legendary film. a film that i will always cherish  and a film that i will never get tired of. and the last vietnam film worth a damn to watch. there isn't any war film today that was filmed as really human drama war today in 2015. it respectively represents the very essence of purposefully haunting powerful cinematography in the history.-- it is representing admirable cinematic craftsmanship and storytelling. a film that is sometimes impossible to watch for its frighteningly intense and emotionally draining account of the vietnam war as it is waged both on the battlefields and within the very souls of men.the best real human drama portrayed on screen anti-war film in vietnam from the 80's  it is my favorite film that i will always love to death to see. i also don't watch this film for an action ; i actually see it for the war and how it everything was  what is more valuable and it is life: the film also have a message in it. the actors portraying the characters did make a believable performance as the real team of squad soldier fighting the enemy the viet cong.the battles with viet-cong are shown realistic mostly on the end of the final battle. 10/10"
"harry dean stanton stars as a man who first appears walking alone through the desert terrain of the southwest. after he's hospitalized for heat exhaustion  his brother (dean stockwell) is contacted to come and get him. at first  stanton refuses to speak  and when he eventually does begin to open up  he seems to have memory loss. he's been missing for the past 4 years  and his young 8 year old son has been raised by stockwell and his wife (aurore clement). once stanton seems to stabilize a bit  he and the boy go on a road trip to try and track down the boy's mother (nastassja kinski).harry dean stanton has always been one of my favorite character actors  and i was pleased to see him get a lead role for a change. he's terrific  and the only flaws i could maybe point out were the script's fault and not his. kinski is very good as well. like i said  the script has some issues for me  with the main character arc being a little hard to buy  and the two and a half hour running time could have been trimmed without loss of mood or substantial content. the cinematography by robby muller is fantastic  as is the score by ry cooder. i would still recommend this film  but i was a little disappointed considering it was one of the ""1001 movies to see before you die""."
i would say that paris  texas is not for everyone  but  truly  that can be said about every movie. but i will say this: fans of methodically paced  beautifully shot  existentially rooted  and purely experiential cinema will not be disappointed. paris  texas is virtually my favorite movie  and a movie that  whether you like it or not  will leave some impact on you. it is a journey  an experience  an odyssey. yes  it is long. yes  it is slow. defined plot points? please.but what this movie does do is place into the mind of it's lead character. travis henderson  an older man  gruff and worn out with age  wanders out of the texas desert after missing from his family for four years. he is mute  and apparently unaware of who he is. his brother walt finds him  and tries to rehabilitate him back into sanity. the film then covers travis's journey to reconnect with a past which he has long since forgotten. he reunites with his son  his sister in-law  and eventually  in a scene which i tear up just thinking about  his wife.but that is all i will divulge about his wife. that is a scene which you really have to see to believe. while this film really doesn't rely on plot  it does have structure and tone. and what carries us through this mystical story is the unbelievably beautiful photography. we see the world as it should be seen: a starkly beautiful  but uncompromising  place. the use of color and motifs really makes this film a marvel to look at. and then we get to performances. everyone's great  so i will focus on our two truly main characters. harry dean stanton plays travis  a gentle  kind man  that  despite having personal demons  is a great fatherly figure (fine  maybe he isn't the best father...but there's no denying he left an impact on his son's life). and seeing stanton bring this character to life in the most subtle and somber way possible is amazing. and then we have natassja kinski  who plays jane  his wife. she doesn't show up until the third act  and 95% percent of her performance takes place in one room. but kinski's portrayal of emotion...and her quiet  yet powerful demeanor...and the way she talks...god  it's unbelievable. stanton and kinski have some of the best chemistry ever  which is even more impressive considering they're never in the same room (see the movie...you'll understand). in the end  these two carry the movie on their backs  and do an amazing job doing it.you may not cry  but you will think about crying. you will think about all the sad moments in your life. and it will all be washed out of you by movie's end. believe me  i know this from personal experience. this movie is almost therapeutic in the way. because the story is healing our own souls at the same time as it is healing travis's. so. what's more to say about paris  texas? it's a beautiful movie  one that relies on photography and performances to tell it's story  and a movie that portrays emotions on a master class level. and what do i mean by 'anti-romance'? it's not worth explaining here. see the movie  you'll understand.
i don't know how he does this things (mononoke  nausicaa  spirited away  howl's moving castle and goes on) but i know something that he is one of the most worthiest people living under this blue sky. of course as he says people doesn't care about earth  they even can't feel it and i agree with him. he tries to make at least a few people feel it. miyazakisan please go on what you are doing... in another part of this world  people that you don't even know they are living  sometimes laughs and sometimes cries with you. and i'm sure that when you finished making that movies. you cried out too.. farewell this movie is for people who can feels the wind
"the name of nausicaä belongs to greek mythology; she was the princess who saved ulysses from drowning. and the ""valley of the winds"" was loosely inspired from the tragedy of minimata bay and the way it maintained its ecosystem viable despite the pollution. ""nausicaä of the valley of the winds"" finds the perfect balance between the theme of nature always finding its way and the dramatic struggle of a heroine saving humanity from ""drowning"" in belligerent wickedness.i'm mentioning minimata but the tragedy of fukushima could have inspired a similar intuition that technological advances could only lead to the downfall of humanity inasmuch as men continue to display the same carelessness and arrogance. in his ""nausicaä""  hayao miyazaki doesn't warn us but rather confronts us to a plausible future  a future with a few survivors driven to the last corners of earth where wind and water prevented a toxic jungle name fukaï from spreading.the film  all in visual splendor  displays the usual sci-fi and fantasy archetypes but they don't distract from the environmentalist and pacifist message. we accept them in the sense that the story is set one thousand years after the apocalypse and we expect technology to have produced jet-propelled gliders and flying vessels. but the film also has a renaissance look à la ""princess mononoke""  it's not an artistic license  the privileged people of the valley represent a wiser side of humanity that got back to the roots  acknowledging the eminence of nature  a renaissance indeed.they live in an oasis-like area where the air is breathable  outside; they must wear a gas mask  accentuating the dystopian look even within a natural setting. the hostility of nature is symbolized by giant mutant insects and the ohm  armored trilobite-like insects whose eyes turn to an ominous red whenever they feel threatened. but miyazaki never lets us get the wrong idea about these ohm  understand they're not the most life-threatening creatures out there.there's a key scene right in the beginning where a little fox-like creature bites nausicaä  she patiently keeps her finger until its frenzy fades out and then the animal licks her wound. this moment is pivotal because it highlights the real tragedy that caused men's downfall  not violent actions but immediate assumptions of violence causing bad reactions. only nausicaä is capable of showing mercy and empathy toward any living creature  she challenges all the common conceptions and even tries to understand the place she lives in  which is the epitome of wisdom.from the spores taken during regular expedition  she discovers in her laboratory that plants are capable of producing air  later in the film that some jungle plants purify the polluted topsoil and produce clean water. in other words  life always finds a way but humans can't see it. nausicaä becomes the messianic character that will open the eyes of humanity  and as truth can be stranger than fiction  she's also a pivotal moment in miyazaki's career  as the first film to have emerged from the fertile soil of his own imagination.nausicaä foreshadows all the elements that will define his work: the independent free-spirited heroine  the aerial settings and the environmental and anti-war messages  and more than that  the revolutionary notion that you don't need villains to make a story. everyone is imperfect and fallible  even the most violent attacks are meant as defensive moves or precautions. the film contains a lot of action  lethal explosions and battles  people die by the sword  including nausicaä's but miyazaki couldn't have been more pacifists  every detail says in subtext that violence isn't the answer.indeed  how can the cause of the trouble ever be the solution? miyazaki  a master storyteller  delivers crucial information even in the most unnoticeable moments  even the opening credits show through roman mosaic and medieval tapestry the fate of the modern world. seven giants launching immense fire blasts (metaphor for nuclear power?) into modern buildings  it's just as if hiroshima was depicted like the pompeii eruption. but what is the tragedy exactly  that history taught men a lesson or that men didn't learn it? nausicaä is set at a time that looks like a second chance but people are still fighting for good or bad reasons  from a sword master and father-figure named lord yupa  a young pejite interceptor who respects nausicaä's actions and the tolmekian queen who (like lady eboshi from ""mononoke"") is perhaps the tumultuous counterpart to nausicaä  mutilated by the creatures  she believes in violence as the language of the force  illustrating its dangerously communicative effect  the never-ending spiral that killed the world or that might lead to a third worldwide conflict.and in the midst of nihilistic violence and desolation  nausicca emerges as a beautifully inspirational heroine. there's a hypnotic flashback (with a so-catchy playful tone) where nausicaä's father kills a baby ohm  on the basis that human and insects can't live together. the whole conviction of nausicaä is that every creature has its place on earth; it's not just about empathy but the unshakable faith on nature's equilibrium. it is very significant that the most beautiful images from the film  all in golden yellow  are provided by the ohm's tentacles  weren't they supposed to be the ugly monsters? yet  at the time of its release  the film was badly edited for foreign audiences and lost into translation to become some manga adventure in the air  and the ohm were indeed hostile creatures. it's just as if miyazaki was ahead of his time and it would take one decade and half before people would come back to their senses and realize that this isn't ""flash gordon"". nausicaä is about conviction and goodness  pacifism and environmentalism deprived from any political innuendo.miyazaki drew the original manga so the film could be made  showcasing as much confidence as his heroine. in a way  miyazaki was the nausicaä of animation  a man with a vision  spirit and guts."
"hitting the video store late on a saturday when all of the current films were unavailable  we ran across the thing in the ""classic"" racks. i've seen this film at least twice before and truly enjoyed seeing it again. if it lacks plot or character development  the premise is frightening enough to make it an engrossing film. the gross-out special effects don't hurt either. for me  the thing ranks with alien as one of the best scary films i 've seen."
"a classic film. john carpenter's ""the thing"" is one of the most entertaining horror films ever made - fast  clever and purely exciting from start to finish. it is one of my personal favorite horror movies. this is how all movies of the genre should be made. set on an isolated base in antarctica  this version seems almost to pick up where the original version (the thing from another world) left off. the american scientists discover a decimated norwegian base some miles distant. everyone is dead  and only the half charred remains of some unidentifiable thing left to smolder outside the compound might offer any answers to what may have happened. the thing is brought back to the american base and  too late  the scientists realize that it is alive and lethal. the thing thaws out and is off  not only killing anyone and anything that crosses its path  but also absorbing them  making itself into whoever and whatever it wants. the film then turns into a brilliant paranoia piece. everyone is suspect  anyone can be the thing  and no one trusts anyone anymore. gone is the strength and security found when human beings band together in spite of their differences to battle a monster. the group splinters and fear rules supreme. who is the thing?seriously i love this movie i love it to death. i love escape from new york and i love escape from l.a. but i also love the thing so much better this is definitely the best carpenter film a truly masterpiece classic i love r.j. macready - kurt russell i love everything about this film that is. science fiction  horror and an action epic film. a lot of the practical effects were left out but the it looked nice and the acting was good and it expanded upon the monsters background and showing you the inside of the ship. it must of been tough to bring across on screen the visual design. in my opinion  nobody has topped this film in the 25-odd years since its release. i'll put any of ""the thing's"" old-school effects up against any cgi-driven movie  or this cast against almost any other ensemble. if you haven't seen the film yet  i envy you because i wish i could see ""the thing"" again for the first time. wow! does more need to be said? how about this...there is no parallel. who's your friend? who's the thing? who do you trust? who can you afford to trust? if you've never seen this movie...your in for a treat. the only other movie that had such an impact on me was the matrix (the first movie)...where i left the theater touching the walls wondering if they were really real. this movie will leaving you wondering....is the guy/gal next to you really real?""trust is a tough thing to come by these days."" john carpenter's the thing is a seminal piece of horror that is not only a fine specimen of its era  but it also serves as a shining example of horror done absolutely right in any era. combining gross-out special effects reminiscent of hellraiser  the nail-bitingly intense  claustrophobic filmmaking of alien  offering a story that is very well-paced  such as george a. romero's dawn of the dead  and presenting the idea that true terror can be found at any time  in any place  and inside anyone  much like alfred hitchcock's psycho  the thing works on every level  and represents the peak of each and every aspect that may be utilized to make horror films effective. granted  this amalgamation of styles is not the only formula for winning horror.the basic plot about this movie is horror-moister john carpenter (halloween  escape from new york) teams kurt russell's outstanding performance with incredible visuals to build this chilling version of the classic the thing. in the winter of 1982  a twelve-man research team at a remote antarctic research station discovers an alien buried in the snow for over 100 000 years. once unfrozen  the form-changing alien wreaks havoc  creates terror and becomes one of them.it is one of the best favorite horror films of the 80's ever. i love this film to death. the thing is the best classic horror film from master and genius john carpenter! 'the thing' is classic carpenter and one of the few remakes that is better than the original. kurt russell's characters: snake plissken  r.j. macready and jack burton are kurt's best favorite characters he ever played. i also love the music score from ennio morricone! awesome!!! 10/10 grade: bad ass seal of approval"
"sometimes you just need to give a film a second chance  even if it is 20 years later! only some rave reviews about the picture quality of this new 5-disc ""complete collector's edition"" enticed me to watch this again. wow  i am glad; this was a very entertaining and a tremendous visual and audio treat.i actually appreciated the audio best because  even in this new blu-ray era  one doesn't often find a film with very active surround speakers. however  this ""restored"" version did and the sound is  at the point  the best i've heard on a blu-ray disc....or any dvd  for that matter. the visuals? well  fans of blade runner know all about them. they are fantastic. scene-after-scene reminded me of a stanley kubrick film or another bizarre 1980s movie called ""jacob's ladder.""because there are so many things to see and hear  and the story is different  one filled with strange characters  i can see where people would watch this film multiple times and enjoy it very much each time. the ""collector's edition"" has the best picture ever  according to director ridley scott  and ""is the version i'm most pleased with."" it has added scenes one didn't see in earlier versions. the rest of the dvd has those earlier versions. apparently  there are several including those with harrison ford doing narration  like out of a late '40s film noir.speaking of the latter  that's what this film looked like: a combination film noir (or neo-noir) and sci-fi movie. it has many dark images  fantastic night-time scenes  wonderful closeups and an always-interesting color palette. sci-fi films usually get dated in a hurry  thanks to ever-increasing special-effects progress in the movie industry  but this still looks very good. despite being made over 25 years ago  blade runner still looks very much state-of-the-art.scott says this is the best version and the best his film has ever looked and sounded. since it's his movie  who am i to argue. so  if you're like me and never gave this movie a chance (i lost interest halfway through with my vhs look at it)  give this a second look on this blu-ray edition....and you will be blown away. this is  indeed  an amazing film."
"a feast for the eyes. dark and uncompromising. with a haunting musical score by vangelis that adds a hypnotic quality to those breathtaking megacity landscapes of future los angeles. ridley scott's adaptation of philip k. dick's post-apocalyptic bounty hunter story 'do androids dream of electric sheep' is a visionary work of art; it's a dystopian masterpiece and i'd personally call it as much a milestone of science fiction as kubrick's '2001' (and be advised to watch the version known as the ""final cut"" if you want to catch 'blade runner' as it was intended by its director). it's hard to overstate how influential the film was; it invented the sci-fi subgenre now known as ""cyberpunk""  and it was also the first ""film noir"" in a sci-fi setting. and although it looks so distractingly gorgeous that even today there are people who still dismiss it as superficial and mere ""eye candy""  it is a philosphically deep film that ponders existential questions about the nature of being human. its slow  brooding quality will perhaps leave some modern audiences who are used to a different pace and more action underwhelmed - but make no mistake: this is a groundbreaking masterwork of its genre and a timeles classic. 10 stars out of 10.favorite films: imdb.com/list/mkjokvqlsbs/lesser-known masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/"
"anthony hopkins is so associated with hannibal lecter  that we almost forget that he did star in movies before that. ""the elephant man""  for example. it's sort of hard to determine whether the main character is disfigured john merrick (john hurt) or dr. frederick treves (hopkins). either way  it's the movie's plot that's important. the plot of course shows how merrick has been treated as a monster all his life and treves tries to cure him. as for the possibility that the movie may have revered its subject too much...well  would you feel comfortable mocking him? a particularly interesting combo is the people behind the movie: director david lynch and executive producer mel brooks (brooks' wife anne bancroft appears as an actress). the former is synonymous with deliberately weird cinema  while the latter is synonymous with silliness. both men show a different side here. all in all  this is definitely a movie that everyone should see."
if one was to turn on david lynch's the elephant man midway through  without knowing what it was  one might be startled at the appearance of the main character. one might even be tempted to make fun of the character. but if one was to watch the film from the beginning  one's sympathy with john merrick (john hurt)  'the elephant man ' would be strong enough to deny that the former situation was ever a possibility. lynch does not allow his audience to glimpse merrick sans mask until his appearance has been built up substantially. when we the audience are at our zenith of anticipation  we see him-no dramatic music  no slow motion; a simple cut and he's there. there he is. and it's no big deal. this is the beauty of lynch's direction. we are led through our morbid curiosity at the same rate the characters in the film are. we develop alongside them. more specifically  we develop alongside frederick treeves  played with an astounding sublimity of emotion by anthony hopkins. next to treeves we pity merrick  respect him  pity him again  and then ask ourselves with him  'is he just a spectacle to me? am i a bad person?'lynch certainly doesn't let us bypass this question easily. are we bad people for being intrigued or are we good people for pitying? certainly there is a mix of intrigue and pity with every character who first meets john  and we are not excluded. however  as with almost every character who truly comes to know john and confer with him  we learn to respect him as a human being and not as a spectacle. nonetheless  this issue never finds close in the film  nor do i feel it ever can be closed in actual life. hopkin's treeves is never fully sated in how he feels about this dilemma  and so  neither can we be.technically  the elephant man is a beautifully shot film. in crisp black and white  the film recalls the cinematic technique of american cinema circa the 1930's. the scenes dissolve into one another; there is no brisk editing. the lighting is kept low-key during dark scenes  balanced during daytime scenes-this is standard film-making of the era. the one digression from this form are the distinctly lynchian surrealities-pseudo-dream-sequences of commendably original imagery that break up the film and serve as distinct mood-setters for the audience. these are  for the most part  fairly intimidating sidenotes. we as an audience are caught off-guard because in these tangents we are not identifying with treeves  we are put instead into merrick's shoes. it is unsettling.but lynch has never been a director to flinch at unsettling prospects. we must watch merrick beaten  abused  harassed  humiliated  and tormented. we may feel a surge of happiness when he finally stands up for himself  but by that point we still have to cope with what we've already  what he's already  experienced. i suppose that is the greatest and most devastating aspect of the film-empathy. every moment is heartbreaking. yet no matter how hard it gets  and how much better it then turns  there is always the threat of another jab. and those jabs only get more and more painful.the elephant man is a perfect film. it is sorrowful but it apologizes not at all for it. it is a film about where our empathy stems from  a film that asks you to feel sorry but rebukes you for your blind pity. it asks you to respect merrick  not cry for him. but you can't help crying. the elephant man is a film that treks you through despair and asks for your hope in the end. it asks you to hate humanity but to love the humane. it asks you to look at a man who appears sad and know that inside  he's okay.
i have been reading the reviews  and i'm just happy to see that there still are some people out there who appreciate real comedy. for anyone who is willing to actually watch the movie  and not expect a zoolander-ish barrage of fleetingly funny moments  this is definitely one of the funniest movies in the history of film. one may watch this movie a hundred times  and still find parts of it he never noticed before. the scene with michael palin chained up to the wall in the dungeon is possibly the most perfect absurd comedy sketch in existence. (oh  what i wouldn't give to be spat at in the face!) even better than the dead parrot! and the movie has a wonderful unity as well  as a massive (semi-serious) satire of not just religion  but humanity in general. two of them went to oxford  three to cambridge--these guys are well educated  and their work is absolutely brilliant  simply funny on the surface and hilariously complex beneath. this movie is better than holy grail  and is the python's finest work.
"personally  i believe this to be one of the most intelligent comedies ever made. it might not appear that way at first because the film does have its share of simple slapstick and ""naughty"" moments  but generally  the topics the pythons tackle here are very serious - albeit dealt with in a way that makes this a true contender for the funniest film of all time. a firework of hilarious sketches  timeless quotes and clever comments on the human condition  this film was deemed too dangerous for the masses and therefore  until recently  banned in several countries (normally  this only used to happen to the so called ""video nasties"").this film never once makes fun of jesus (christ) - but it does take the mickey out of blind  fanatic followers of any political movement or religion.an outstanding achievement and endlessly re-watchable. my vote: 10 out of 10favorite films: http://www.imdb.com/list/mkjokvqlsbs/lesser-known masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/favorite low-budget and b-movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/favorite tv-shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/"
"of the first two american films about the vietnam war with a priceless artistic weight  ""the deer hunter"" wins hands down over ""apocalypse now"" (1979) although francis ford coppola's work is very potent too.but would it be judicious to pigeonhole michael cimino's work in the category of the war movie? unlike coppola's visual nightmare  only the central part takes place in vietnam and the filmmaker barely shoots one fight sequence before mike (robert de niro)  nick (christopher walken) and stevie (john savage) are prisoners of the enemy and are forced to play russian roulette in the notorious unbearable scene. actually ""the deer hunter"" is a film straddling two movie genres: the war movie and the social drama. rather than shooting a political film  cimino chose to represent us the deadly impact this nightmarish war had on an american community whose hopes and values disappeared.dividing his work in three parts: before  during  after and thanks to symbolical images  scenes or even eloquent details  cimino used and honed his own cinematographic language to set out his stalls and the result can only command respect and admiration. each sequence could be separately taken and carefully studied like the representation of the humdrum but reassuring living standards of the blue-collars with their everyday rituals (cimino's obsession with rites and customs) revolving around factory  bar  friends and hunting (you have to admire the startling contrast between the dirty little town and the gorgeous  wild landscapes). archetypal sequences that epitomize life and it reaches its height in the famous  unusually long wedding sequence. perhaps cimino wanted to stretch this sequence to make his characters take advantage of this rapture moment. but even during this state of bliss that lives inside them  the imminent tragedy ominously lurks: mike and nick gently laugh at an officer who remains dumb and when stevie and his wife have to drink in a dish  some drops fall on her wedding dress. this sequence also epitomizes the polar opposite to the sequence of the russian roulette in which death is just around the corner. after the war when mike comes back to the small town  he's completely altered. before  a devotee of deer hunting; after his traumatizing experience  he can't kill one. he's unable to talk about about what he went through and for his sidekicks  the experience of a war like this one is incomprehensible. cimino eschews classical  predictable storytelling and hasn't recourse to psychological study. nearly everything occurs in gestures and looks while the suggested has a meaty part in the dialogs. besides  during the whole movie the topic of the war is barely mentioned by the characters. a lyrical whiff blows on the film  dovetailed by cimino's astounding directing.cimino was consumed with ambition and went at it hammer and tongs to get his crew completely involved in his project. he was hard on his actors (robert de niro has often said that ""the deer hunter"" was his most grueling role to date) and was obsessed with absolute control. but the efforts weren't vain at all and gave a heartfelt  invaluable yardstick in war movie  even american cinema which reached the streets when america rose from its ruins. it was also the beginning of the end for cimino  a filmmaker ahead of his time and on the fringe of cinematographic trends."
i am a combat veteran of afghanistan.we don't know why some of us come back and others do not. war is a gamble.this film deeply touched my soul.
"yes  this film is cute  upbeat  and likable. but the plot is so obvious and clichéd. heavyweight champion apollo creed needs a boxing partner for his next fight and it is decided to give an average joe boxer the chance to win the title on january 1  1976  the 200th anniversary of the united states declaring independence. well actually that would be july 4  but i won't quibble. that average joe is 3rd rate boxer rocky balboa (sylvester stallone) who makes ends meet by collecting for a mobster.rocky only has eyes for cripplingly shy plain adrian (talia shire) who works in the pet store. adrian lives with her alcoholic bully of a brother  paulie  who is a butcher and friends with rocky. it would be easy to scratch your head and ask why rocky never gave up pursuing adrian who  if she wasn't disinterested  was so shy she might never come out of her shell. but rocky saw himself as a diamond in the rough  regardless of other people's opinions  and i think he took the time to realize this young woman was a diamond in the rough too if only she would come out of that shell.now everybody who can disrespects rocky - the driver of the mobster he works for is always insulting him  a neighborhood girl who is hanging out with the bad kids is given an endearing lecture by rocky about girls who have bad ""reps"" only to have her make an obscene gesture as they part after walking home  and most of all mick (burgess meredith)  who runs the local gym  is always yelling at rocky about what a loser he is.when it becomes known that rocky has been given a shot at the title  suddenly people want a piece of him. mick comes to him and wants to be his manager. rocky is not stupid. he realizes the difference in treatment is because of the opportunity he has been given  and if not for that people would still be walking on him. the scene between him and mick where rocky explodes with resentment is really good acting by stallone.so rocky does ultimately let mick train him  and the scene of rocky running after mick after rocky at first threw him out of his apartment is shot from a distance  so we never know what was said  and that again is good filmmaking. rocky takes the whole thing seriously while creed is too busy with public appearances to train.in parallel with rocky's training is his romance with adrian who transforms from a plain looking girl into a stylish pretty girl. this is one of those obvious things because talia shire was not an unknown. she was in the godfather for pete's sake  so the audience knows she is not ugly. just don't style her hair  dress her drably  no makeup and some geeky looking glasses and voila - the ugly duckling. rocky's unconditional love gives her confidence to dress well and present herself attractively.so the big day comes  rocky has done his homework  creed hasn't really prepared  expecting this to be a three round publicity stunt. adrian has changed so much that nobody who knew her three months ago could recognize her in a lineup. how does all of this end up? watch and find out.i don't think this was the best picture of 1976  but it was probably the most upbeat of the a pictures that came out that year. look at its competition - ""all the president's men"" which was about watergate  ""network"" about a bloodless television executive who will do anything for ratings  ""taxi driver"" about a psychologically troubled ex-marine  and ""bound for glory"" about a folk singer of the depression era who died of just about the worst disease on earth. maybe the academy just wanted to pick a feel good film  and rocky was the only one that fit that bill."
"it's hard to explain what this movie means to me. words could never. i remember when i was a kid  i never liked the first rocky  was too obsessed with iii and iv. it happened when i was 11 and i went to see v in the theater. i never been to a movie like that before. people were screaming and cheering. shook the whole damn place. they were dancing in the isle's and celebrating. it was then i realized the true power of stallone's vision. the realization that only the original would ever really matter.rocky to me is so many things. i had to beg my girlfriend to see it. she said she doesn't like boxing. i almost dumped her right there. if she wasn't so hot  i probably would have. i was crushed that someone could think that this movie is about boxing. to me it was never that. it's about a guy  much like you or me  who's down on his luck and everyday feels like sunday. he's pushing 30  single and broke. i'm sad to say that at this moment it almost reminds me of myself. every minute more another reason. it's hard to pick my favorite scenes from the movie. i love the chemistry between rocky and adrian (shire). when he's talking to door and she finally comes out and then stops to look in the mirror. it's a thing of beauty. or when mickey (meredith) goes over to stallones apartment. rocky gets upset and punches his shitty wall  then goes to hide in the bathroom. the look on stallone's face when he comes out to find mickey still there is priceless. i heard it wasn't in the script or directed  just happened. but the one that does it for me is when he comes home in the opening scene after the chapel fight. he turns on his record player and goes for a beer  but it's empty  like everything else in his life. talks to the turtles and his fish  why because the rock is lonely. goes to the mirror and practices a joke for his love. looks at a picture of himself and realizes he's wasting his life. it's more than beautiful or real.it's safe to say that i have seen the original more than 100 times. i still feel all the emotion. i love this movie more than any other film. i hope one day  with god's help  to show it to my kids and have them feel the same way. i think if i ever got the chance to meet stallone  i'd want to thank him. tell him how he changed my life. but in reality  he probably wouldn't care. because  ""i'm at least half a bum."""
"when this movie came out in '76 i didn't bother seeing it because i rejected the premise as implausible; the very idea that a network anchor would go nuts on the air and become a hook for ratings seemed ridiculous on its face.
would that it were so.today we have jerry springer  maury povich  howard stern  etc. etc. etc. at the beginning of the movie a drunken max schumacher (william holden) fantasizes about a show called ""the death hour"" comprised of films of car crashes  suicides  train wrecks  and so forth  to be put on sunday night in prime time. ""it'll blow disney outta the f------g water!"" he laughs. a few years back some network put exactly such a show - ""eye witness videos"" - on the air. on sunday night. in prime time. in short  as most everyone here has commented  ""network""'s horrifying vision - brilliantly written by the incredibly prescient paddy chayevsky -  has been truly and frighteningly prophetic  and rings absolutely true today.the movie is a veritable feast of tour-de-force acting from all involved. in particular  william holden's wrenching performance as the burned-out but still sensitive max is drop-jaw stunning. i feel he  not finch  should have gotten the oscar  though finch's work is not exactly chopped liver either. and what a brilliant device on chayevsky's part to make the lunatic howard beale the only one of the bunch with clarity of vision.
that the film is intended to be a satire and a comedy is clear from the narration  especially the final comment about beale becoming the first man to be killed because of lousy ratings. but it is without doubt the blackest black comedy ever filmed. a lasting legend of filmmaking art."
to think that this blackest of black comedies was made in 1976 could only means two things: 1) nothing has changed or 2) paddy chayefsky was seeing the future with the most disturbing clarity. i endorse the later of the two because i believe things have changed since 1974 - i wasn't born yet  but i know because of my parents  the movies  literature  etc  etc  etc. peter finch as the mad prophet of the airwaves gives chayefsky a riveting and powerful voice. the scenes between old chums finch and william holden are some of the best written scenes in any american movie until the coen brothers emerged. finch is superb  superb! and holden  at the end of a legendary career  gives a performance of such ferocious sincerity that i rediscovered the man  the actor and felt the need to revisit some of his opus. from golden boy to sunset boulevard  holden was a man who carried his own discomfort as a weapon. extraordinary! however  the most alarming character in the whole thing is faye dunaway's. she is magnificent in her thin  nervous  bra-less attitude. she is a monster of commercial amorality. everything in this incredible movie moves with the precision of an inspired clairvoyant's vision. duvall's executive  beatrice straight's betrayed wife and ned beatty's god like big shot makes this one of the most frightening  entertaining  funniest  remarkable film from the 70's. sidney lumet proves once more that he's as good as his material. here he is at his zenith.
"with such etiquettes  stanley kubrick's ""barry lyndon"" allows you to  through the lens of an observer  watch the rise and fall of british war hero redmond barry. this film has always been near the top of stanley kubrick's filmography for me and is a film that should be in any gentleman's watch list. a forgotten masterpiece indeed."
"in the midst of the many wonderful films made by stanley kubrick  it is strange to note how rarely people mention ""barry lyndon"".the film portrays an unusual young irish man  redmond barry  and his endeavours as he is forced to leave his home and tries to make good his life elsewhere. his life away from home starts out as a career in the british army; only to evolve in surprising ways and lead to as different places as a position of trust within the prussian army and later a title of nobility  gained by what our time can only measure as rather disgraceful means.some consider barry lyndon a slow and tedious film  and it is in deed past three hours in length  but this is because of the artistic flow of a film that strays not only to tell a tale about a man who is by no means neither hero nor villain  but also a film which is in no hurry and takes the time for every detail to sink into the mind and heart of the viewer. some of the scenic images in ""barry lyndon"" are in themselves pieces of art  rendered with a passion for the landscapes and the man-made structures within them.the myth that all scenes were recorded using no artificial lighting no doubt stems from the very realistic lights during indoor takes  and some of them truly did not feature artificial light. this is but one of the many details that so easily conveys a sense of a realistic portray of the era; the 18th century and the time after the seven-year war in the later half of the century. the impressive atmosphere and the wonderfully picturesque scenarios along with the fact that the entire plot moves at a calm pace makes this film a very pleasant experience.""barry lyndon is""  amidst kubricks' many masterpieces  a film so easily dismissed due to length and the fact that it is overshadowed by others  but i deeply recommend this film to anyone who would like to see a film both for the plot line  the story and the pure enjoyment of the images presented. stanley kubrick made many great films  and this one is most definitely one of them! kimotocat"
"in cool hand luke paul newman shows us what the underside of what life is like as a rebel. picture james dean doing this part had he lived to do films like these.newman plays his usual non-conformist rebel type  but he's really a rebel without a cause. he's in his early forties  a korean war veteran who just hasn't found his place in civilian life. he gets himself busted for no great cause  just on a drunken spree in some southern town he decides to knock the heads off a bunch of parking meters.that lands him a stint in a county jail with a lot of outdoor work on a road gang. he fights with  but later wins the respect and becomes friends with george kennedy the head honcho in his barracks.the real tragedy of cool hand luke is that newman is a failure in life  it's why he's in prison. he gains the respect of his fellow convicts for those ways  but that involves going against the penal system and in the end that gets you nothing. can you picture james dean as a forty something doing what newman is doing? it would have been his kind of role for sure.newman does a fine job playing the non-conformist luke who seems to be just going on the path fate has decreed for him. george kennedy got his oscar winning career role as dragline. other men in luke's barracks are wayne rogers  robert drivas  and j.d. cannon and they fill their roles well.strother martin as the warden of the place is the guy with the film's favorite line  ""what we've got is failure to communicate."" martin and his correction officers have many interesting ways of getting their point across.cool hand luke may very well be the saddest role newman ever undertook in his long career."
"this film got me from the first frame to the last. it's not even because of the story (which i love  of course) - it's just so very well made. and so modern. the kind of angles and perspectives the camera uses  the way it zooms in and out or even allows itself (literally) to get dirty - the way this whole picture was shot is just something i haven't seen in an american film released prior to this one. and yet  although it is considered a classic  when people talk about the ""new hollywood"" somehow 'cool hand luke' is hardly ever mentioned - despite the fact that it came out only a couple of months after 'bonnie and clyde' in 1967 and before 'the graduate'. i look at this film mainly as a character study but the story arc also works very well and it hasn't aged a bit. this is one of those rare films that was way ahead of its time and which has simply everything: great acting  iconic characters and scenes  wonderful music - and the cinematography is just unbelievable. funny  tragic and moving  'cool hand luke' is one hell of a film. what we've got here is not failure to communicate - but a 10 star masterpiece.favorite films: http://www.imdb.com/list/mkjokvqlsbs/lesser-known masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/favorite low-budget and b-movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/favorite tv-shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/"
"""persona"" is one of those films that just about everyone will tell you is a masterpiece. yet for some  this conclusion is neither apparent nor obvious.plot in a nutshell: a nurse (bibi andersson) is assigned to care for a seemingly healthy woman (liv ullmann)  apart from her sudden - and stubborn - reticent behavior.i've read many reviews of this film  and i don't know if any two of them agree on what it is actually about  or what it's trying to say. that is not a good sign. everyone  or almost everyone  must be confused  then  on its message and purpose  if no one can agree. and rest assured  this film is confusing. unlike most others  it does not tell its story in a conventional way. most films you watch  you can follow the plot and dialogue  and you understand what is happening on the screen. that is not the case with ""persona."" you don't know if the two main characters are actually one character  if they are in fact separate  is it about duality  or schizophrenia  or something else again? ""persona"" has rightly been called the ""mt. everest for film analysis"" because it feels like an insurmountable task to accurately decipher and understand it.it's like a jackson pollock painting  when he threw buckets of paint on a canvas and called it 'art.' who knows what all of those splotches meant? do they have meaning? or is this just random artistic expression? that was up to the individual. and so it is with ""persona."" some people will view it and see genius; others will look at it and see a mishmash of images and shapes that don't amount to anything of interest or substance. i never cared for pollock; give me monet or van gogh any day.roger and me: roger ebert reviewed this film twice  in 1967 and again in 2001  and both times he rated it 4/4. however he also wrote that he returns to it in the 'hope to understand its mysteries.' so he  too  still didn't understand it after multiple viewings. i've seen it once and don't care if i never see it again. life is too short to waste on trying to figure out what bergman wanted to say  if indeed he was actually saying anything at all; we'll never get the answer.4/10. would i watch again (y/n)?: not very likely.(incidentally  alma the nurse could have had a successful career writing for penthouse forum; her 'beach story' scene is easily the best part of the film!)"
"ingmar bergman's mystifying masterpiece  persona  opens with an image  of light from the lamp of a film projector and then the film running  through the spools. this is followed by a series of images that  includes a spider  a montage from silent comedies  a spike being driven  through a man's hand  and faces in a morgue. the film then cuts to an  enigmatic picture of a young boy watching women's faces appear on a  giant screen directly in front of him. are these strange images  reminding us that we are only observing a film  not reality?   as persona begins  sister alma (bibi andersson)  a nurse  is assigned  to care for an actress  elizabeth vogler (liv ullman) who suddenly  ceases to speak in the middle of a performance of electra. alma learns  that there is nothing physically or psychologically wrong with  elizabeth. she just refuses to communicate verbally. alma and elizabeth  retreat to the head physician's summer cottage on a small island to  complete her recuperation. although alma is the only one who talks  the  relationship grows and alma is happy that she has found someone who  will listen to her sympathetically. she begins to share with elizabeth  some of her most vulnerable moments. a high point in the film is alma's  detailed description of a sexual encounter she had with two teenage  boys while sunbathing on a beach in the nude. elizabeth appears to be  an attentive listener who  by facial expression  encourages alma to  reveal more and more personal details.   alma  however  is deeply hurt when she opens elizabeth's unsealed  letter to her doctor. in the letter  elizabeth reveals how she is using  alma as a ""study"" and finds her infatuation ""charming"". feeling  betrayed alma lashes out in anger  first berating her patient  then  begging for forgiveness. as soon as physical and emotional violence is  depicted  bergman stops the narrative and repeats images from the  opening sequence  adding a close-up of an eye as if to remind us again  that we are merely prying observers. the relationship of the two women  now becomes a struggle of wills. alma grows more desperate as elizabeth  gets stronger and more dominant. sensing this new power  elizabeth  seems to transfer her personality to the weaker alma. every nuance of  emotion is unforgettably conveyed in the facial expressions of these  two remarkable actresses.   persona is filled with surreal images and dream sequences in which it  is very difficult to distinguish between illusion and reality. in one  scene  alma sees elizabeth entering her room at night  then exiting.  when alma asks her the next morning if she was in her room  elizabeth  shakes her head no. we do not know if she is simply not telling the  truth  or the event did not occur. bergman does not offer help. the  same is true for scenes when mr. vogler appears or when elizabeth looks  at a picture of her son that she tore up at the beginning of the film.  being left on our own to make sense of these discontinuous elements  we  are forced to discard thinking in traditional linear ways.   i can't say that i fully understood persona. it may be suggesting that  the persona we assume is merely a mask to cover our fears and  insecurities? it seems that elizabeth is playing a role as actress   wife  and mother. she wants to abandon this inauthentic role by  refusing to speak. alma  on the other hand  acts like a dutiful wife  and supportive nurse  but secretly yearns to be what she perceives  elizabeth to be: strong  independent  and self-reliant. in a memorable  scene  the faces of the two women are morphed into one composite in a  classic overlapping shot  an image that says to me that underneath the  roles we play  we are all the same.  after successive viewings  however  i realized that persona's greatness  does not lie in understanding  but in its unbearably intimate and  poetically realized images  magnificently conveyed by cinematographer  sven nykvist. the raw power of this film totally drew me in and allowed  me to get in touch with my own feelings of hurt and desperation in  trying to reach people in my own life who cannot or will not respond.  persona is not just a classic i objectively admired  but a very  powerful personal experience."
the camera work in this movie is wonderful from start to end. unfortunately  the beauty of the camera work sometimes gets in the way of the story-telling. in almost every scene  the camera lingers beautifully on scenes  so that i both appreciate the visual art and wish the movie would hurry up and tell the story. all of the acting is very good  but it's rarely demanding because the camera owns the scenes  not the actors.the story is episodic  with little connection between most of the segments except the recurrence of the title character  a 15th century icon-painter. the first episode  about people flying a hot-air balloon  seems to have no connection to the rest. in another episode  andrei wanders into the frolicking nudity of a pagan summer festival  where his monastery robes make him obviously out of place.a few of the episodes shared another connection besides having andrei present. the connection is a pair of twin brothers  both princes  who hate each other. in one of those  a prince guides a band of tatar horsemen to vladimir  a town ruled by his brother. he invites the tatars to loot it  so that in the process they will kill or terrorize many of the other prince's subjects and ruin one of his towns.one episode can't properly be described without a spoiler warning. skip the rest of this paragraph unless you like spoilers. it shows a band of workers who  after building a palace for one of the twin princes  set off to work on their next construction job. but their next employer is the prince's brother  who intends to employ them to build an even grander palace. the prince sends horsemen after them  where they blind the unfortunate workers. ok  no more spoilers.the best episodes are near the end. the main character in one of them is a woman andrei had rescued during the attack on vladimir. the woman was mute and somewhat disturbed  possibly as a result of the attack. similarly  andrei was deeply troubled by what he had done to rescue her. when tatars appeared again  she ran to their leader. andrei tried to rescue her again  but she resisted. fortunately  she turned out not to need a rescue that time.the final episode was the best of all  and features the most challenging and impressive acting performance. the teenage son of a bell-maker leads the casting of a huge church bell  because all the other bell-makers had died of the plague  and he is the only one who can be found who knows the secret of bell-making. it's a big job  requiring construction of a casting pit  a mold  melting furnaces  and a structure to lift the finished bell from the pit. he is very nervous  because he's doing an expensive  difficult  uncertain job without his father's guidance  for an employer who might kill him if he fails.i saw the director's original 205 minute version  on the criterion dvd. soviet censors cut the movie  troubled by the allegorical reference to treatment of artists  including movie-makers. later distributors cut the movie further  to make it accessible to a broader audience. while i would object to cuts for censorship  i think the movie would tell its story better if it were heavily cut for length. any editing to improve the story-telling would unfortunately come at the cost of some wonderful cinematography  since every scene in the movie was a visual wonder. for all its beauty  i don't think there was even two hours of story-telling in this movie.
andrei rublev (alternately transliterated as andrei rublyov) is an epic film created by the soviet-era director  andrei tarkovsky. it was financed and created during a brief cultural thaw in east-west relations  marked by the end of kruschchev's reign. within reason  the 205 minute director's cut represents exactly what tarkovsky wanted in the movie. unfortunately for tarkovsky and for us  kruschev was deposed shortly after filming began  and the 205 minute version was not seen until twenty five years after its creation. the breszhnev-era censors first trimmed 15 minutes from it  then censors and marketers trimmed more. the shortest known version has been truncated to 145 minutes. even more sadly  tarkovsky was never again to get approval for the projects he really wanted to film  or an adequate budget to film the ones that did get approved.fortunately for us  this movie  recently rereleased in a dvd transferred from a pristine 35mm print  may now be viewed intact  and it is one of the great triumphs of mankind's stay on the planet. it is a masterpiece almost without flaw. the beautiful painterly images follow one another in breathtaking succession. at least three of the eight chapters  if taken individually  could stand alone as separate masterpieces.the ostensible subject is the life of andrei rublev  a 15th century monk who is renowned as russia's greatest creator of religious icons and frescoes. rublev himself  however  is merely a useful device. little is known about him  and most of the episodes in the movie come straight from tarkovsky's imagination of what might have been. sometimes one must ignore the facts to get to the truth.the movie is not about one talented monk  but about russia  and rublev stands in as a useful symbol since he lived in a time when he could personally witness two of the key elements in the development of russia's unique culture: the growing force of byzantine christianity  and the mongol-tatar invasions. in addition he was an artist and a thinker  and experienced first-hand the difficulty of following those paths in russia. rublev's own inner conflicts allow the filmmaker to illuminate thoughts on the pagan and the sacred  the nature of art  the relationship of the artist to the state  what it means to be russian  and what it means to be human.it is beautiful  mystical  and profound  but the truly inspiring aesthetics are matched with complete technical wizardry. i simply don't know how some of the shots were created. one i do understand  and stand in awe of  is a continuous single camera shot  just before the church door is breached by tatar invaders  which involves action in several different locations at multiple elevations as well as the correct timing of hundreds of extras and horses. it makes the first scene of touch of evil look like a high school film project.it is a difficult movie to follow. one might liken it to james joyce's finnegan's wake as a work of genius so monumental and complex  and so disdainful of traditional narrative form  that it requires extensive thought and study to understand it. and even after studying it  watching it repeatedly  and reading tarkovsky's own comments about it  one still finds it opaque in many ways.tarkovsky was free to create the work of art he wanted  without concern for profit. the original 205 minute cut was also free from outside censorship. he used this freedom to realize his personal artistic vision. there is no other movie like it  and there may never be. score it 11 out of 10.
the battle of algiers is a war film based upon occurrences in the eight-year algerian war against french colonial rule in north africa. there were many scenes that were a little hard to watch because of all the people that were killed in the bombings while living their everyday lives. it was interesting to see how many men and women join together to seek revenge against another group. the director cleverly uses imagery to make the viewers see the insight of a terrorist mind. the attacks and battles are insane among one another  accusations towards the innocent. it was an interesting film to watch if you enjoy battle and war films. i personally don't do well in sitting still in these type of films but i did understand what the director portrays. i only recommend this film if you enjoy learning about history and wars.
"perhaps no other cinematic depiction of revolt against colonial rule is so detailed  vivid  and specific as the 1965 battle of algiers (la battaglia di algeri  just reissued in a new print and having limited distribution in the us). it's a vivid and very specific recreation of the insurrection against the french in algiers in the late fifties that shows how the french systematically eradicated that insurrection. it's also a story repeated with variations in dozens of parts of the globe now  as then. but as i'm not the first to note  it's neither a partisan tract nor a user manual. it was therefore foolish of the pentagon to watch it recently as if tips on how to control iraqi `resistance'/'terrorism' were to be found in it  and it has been equally foolish of the black panthers or other revolutionaries to watch it seeking tactical information for their struggles. those tactics did not succeed; but neither did the effort to quell the independence movement: the french won the battle but lost the war. a process that might have proceeded peacefully in a matter of months  takes years to happen. the film documents the sad foolishness of solving conflicts with violence  the maximum loss and suffering on both sides and the protraction of the inevitable outcome.
the insurrection the battle of algiers describes was effectively quelled through the leadership of the bold  methodical french colonel mathieu  who as we see succeeds in eliminating the organizational structure of the resistance  `triangle' by `triangle'  using torture to ferret out names and locations of the autonomous `terrorists'/'partisans ' then killing the `head' of the `worm' their structure represents so it can't `regenerate.' once this happens  after a merciless french campaign following a general strike  the sympathizers in the majority algerian population are totally demoralized; but two years later a vigorous national independence movement `suddenly ' `spontaneously ' springs forth  and not long afterward france has to grant algerian independence. it's at this point  rather than at the moment of mathieu's momentary triumph  that the film ends.
gillo pontecorvo undertook his masterpiece after prodding from the resistance leader  saadi yacef  but he made a film equally sympathetic toward and critical of both sides. we see as much of the french dissection of the situation and repression of it (by the police chief  then colonel mathieu) as we see of the `terrorists'/'partisans' planning and execution of their actions. we see colonel mathieu as an appealing macho hero with moments of noble fair play  a shades-wearing  cigarette puffing veteran who moves around with clarity  honesty  and panache; he himself has a `partisan' background. the `terrorist'/'rebel' leaders are serious  intensely committed men of various types  from the sophisticated intellectual to the young firebrand. there are no `heroes' here; or  alternately  if you like  they're all `heroes.'mathieu appears before the press beside the captured `rebel'/'terrorist' leader - an unusual move in itself - and expresses his respect for the man's courage and conviction. the `rebel' leader in this scene is eloquent in defending `terrorist'/'rebellion' methods such as the use of baskets filled with explosives in public places. `give us your bombs and we'll give you our baskets.' mathieu for his part effectively explains to the journalists the necessity of torture to short circuit the `rebellion'/'terrorism'. after this explanation  the film  typically systematic at this point  begins showing a series of tortures of algerians being carried out.
the first image we see in the film is the shattered face and body of the small  tortured algerian man who's broken down and revealed where ali `la pointe ' the firebrand  the last remaining leader  is hiding. then we see the `terrorist'/'terrorist' leader ali and his closest supporters trapped like deer in their hideaway  their faces soft and beautiful. the splendid black and white photography works like william klein's fifties and sixties images (he's one of the key visual commentators of that period stylistically) to powerfully capture the edgy soulfulness of the north african people and their gritty casbah milieu. much of the film's power comes from the way pontecorvo was able to work  through saadi yacef  directly in the casbah among the real people - as fernando meirelles worked in the favelas of brazil recently with local boys to forge the astonishing city of god.the voices  which are dubbed  as was the fixed italian filmmaking style  work somewhat less effectively because of obvious disconnects between mouth and sound at times  but the french is so analytical and the algerians' arabic so exotic-sounding (even to a student of arabic) that they work  and the insistent  exciting music composed by pontecorvo himself in collaboration with ennio morricone is a powerful element in the film's relentless forward movement.the fast rhythms of the editing are balanced by the stunning authenticity of the hundreds of algerian extras who swarm across the screen: it's in the crowd scenes that the battle of algiers really sings. there are many superb sequences of street fighting  of people massing at checkpoints  of the french victims innocently assembled in public places; and like an exhilarating coda there is the scene of joyous victory as algerians celebrate their independence in the last blurry moments. this is a film (again  like city of god) of almost intoxicating -- and nauseating -- violence  complexity  and fervor. pontecorvo's accomplishment  though  is the way through showing the leaders analyzing and debating the action he freezes any impulse toward partisanship in its tracks. the evenhandedness of the coverage works a brechtian `alienation effect' so you don't get caught up in rooting for one side or the other.the sequence of three pretty algerian women carrying out an operation is a particularly memorable one -- but only one among many. first they take off their burqas and cut their hair and doll themselves up french style and then they get past the checkpoint into the french quarter to leave handbags full of explosives in a bar  a dance club  and an airport lounge. again close-ups of faces in the bar and the jive dancers with jaunty jabbing elbows in the club show a brilliant use of image and classic editing: first the innocent  vulnerable faces  then the explosions. here our sympathies for the french victims are fully awakened. another sequence of algerians removing bodies from a building has all the power and sadness of christ's passion.
there's no point where as in a conventional thriller we feel excitement and sympathy for the perpetrator  because we see the cruelty of the perpetrator and the humanity of the victim every time. the battle of algiers is a final triumphant use of italian cinematic neorealismo. the killing is observed neutrally  but with sadness  as part of a stupid game caused by ignorance and played out compulsively when a political settlement would have been infinitely better - a stupid game observed with astonishing zest.
revived thirty-five years later in a new 35-mm. print  its grainy beauty pristinely vivid  the battle of algiers remains a superbly made machine that plays out the addictive game of `terrorism ' repression  torture  revolt  and full-fledged insurrection as effectively now as when it was first issued. like any classic  it's of its time and of all time. there's a lesson here  but it's not for partisans or colonialists: it's for all people."
"this film  aka  ""the four hundred blows"" is a mistranslation.faire les 400 coups"" means""to live a wild life. as a french i'm stunned when i see the popularity of this good  but by no means outstanding film. 1.it's not the first film of the ""nouvelle vague"" move;check agnes varda's ""la pointe courte"" (1956)alain resnais's ""hiroshima mon amour""(1958) claude chabrol's ""le beau serge""(1958) are anterior .historically ""les 400 coups "" comes after. 2.the ""nouvelle vague"" was sometimes ponderous and hard on their predecessors:overnight julien duvivier henri-george clouzot claude autant-lara  yves allégret and a lot of others were doomed to oblivion.this selfishness and this contempt is typically ""nouvelle vague"".you 've never heard (or read) the great generation of the thirties (renoir carné grémillon duvivier already feyder) laugh at  say maurice tourneur or max linder.so thanks to truffaut and co some people will never discover some gems of the french fifties or forties(duvuvier's ""sous le ciel de paris"" autant-lara's ""douce"" yves allégret's ""une si jolie petite plage "" and ""manèges"").the novelle vague clique went as far as saying that william wyler georges stevens and fred zinemann were worthless! 3.""les 400 coups "" is technically rather disappointing:it's very academic  the story is as linear as it can be the teachers are caricatures and the mother claire maurier delivers such memorable lines as (you've got to be a french circa 1960 to understand how ridiculous  it is): well  your father 's got only his brevet (junior school diploma)and as for me  i've got only my high school diploma!you've got to know that circa 1960 hardly 10%of the pupils had the hsd in france! antoine doinel should have been proud of his mother after all!she wants him to have diplomas who can blame her? 4.compared to the innovations of ""hiroshima mon amour"" which features a brand new form and a new ""fragmented "" content ""les 400 coups "" pales into significance.truffaut will master a new form only with the highly superior ""jules and jim""  helped by the incomparable jeanne moreau. 5.the interpretation is rather stiff;jean-pierre léaud  arguably listenable when dubbed in english  is still decent but he will soon degenerate into the most affected of his generation. 6.the topic=stolen childhood  had better days before (julien duvivier's ""poil de carotte""  luis bunuel's ""los olvidados"") and will have after (maurice pialat's ""l'enfance nue"" kenneth loach's ""kes"") i do not want to demean truffaut his movie is not bad but frankly french movie buffs prefer ""jules and jim"" ""l'enfant sauvage"" (a film honest  true and commercially uncompromizing to a fault)""l'argent de poche""(as academic as ""400 coups"" but much more funny)or his nice hitchcock pastiche ""vivement dimanche""."
every day life  however 'real' and gritty it may be  is rarely portrayed on film and was certainly a rarity in the 1950's. in europe however  there was a movement in film-making that embraced this realism and searched for the deeper meaning in the 'here and now'. this is about the most basic and miniscule portion of the meaning behind the french new wave of the 1950's  films that explored the filmmaker's surroundings  and eventually became an inspiration for filmmakers around the world. francois truffaut's 'the 400 blows' is one of the most well-known films of this movement  and has been embraced and hailed as one of the greatest films of all time.after viewing truffaut's 'the 400 blows'  i have been ruminating over the deeper meaning behind his story of antoine doinel  a 14 year old boy in paris who is having trouble in school and trouble at home. in school  he is marginalized as a trouble-maker  yet it is obvious that it is more a matter of him causing trouble by expressing himself creatively rather than following along with mundane assignments. at home  doinel has to deal with an adulterous mother who only pays attention to him when it suits her needs  and a father who is barely present. doinel responds by doing the only thing he feels he can do  and that is by acting up; eventually earning an expulsion from school and being sent to a juvenile prison camp by his parents. nothing is cut and dry in 'the 400 blows'. if one were to take the film at face value  there would be a 'so what' feeling. what the film subtly explores is the disenfranchisement of youth. there is no joy in doinel's life  anytime he tries to express himself creatively or acts up in a playful way he is shot down and metaphorically forced back into line. this is not a typical paris street kid either  this is one who reads balzac for pleasure and conveys intense emotion. the problem is that no one is there to notice or care. another aspect of the french new wave was that the films were not merely a product of a hollywood factory; these were intensely personal films to the writers and directors. in the case of 'the 400 blows'  it is certain that doinel is based on truffaut  himself only 28 when he made the film. truffaut's cinematography in 'the 400 blows' is exquisite. we see a paris that is not in technicolor with colorful fountains like 'an american in paris'. this is paris from a parisian's perspective  and the difference is breathtaking and intense. these are not louis xvi style houses  they are tiny flats where people have to sleep in closets and walk up and down six flights of stairs. the city views are those of a native parisian  the kind of tour one would get if they asked the average parisian for non-tourist attractions.there is still a lot that i have to learn and think about 'the 400 blows' and french new wave in general  but with the minute amount of understanding i have of it  i found it to be an intense film  one that left me emotional and craving enlightenment. rarely is there a film that leaves that kind of impact on me  but truffaut managed to leave me speechless and deep in thought with 'the four hundred blows'.--shel
ben hur  a tale of the christ  was hugely popular as a novel  a play and two movies. it was written in a less vulgar time about a very spiritual event. seen today by moviegoers addicted to constant action and low frequency effects  it will seem ponderous  slow and pretentious. well  it is a little. you have to pay attention to the dialogue or you won't get it at all. some of the intimate scenes aren't all that great. anyone that really pays attention can tell the sea battle is done with miniatures. it's still worth watching. as everyone ought to know by now  the chariot race is one-of-a-kind; nothing else comes close to that real live race where the main actors actually raced  most of the time. i just watched this movie after lapse of about 10 years. i still enjoyed it. the sea battle is still fun even if you know the boats are about as big as a man. the few moments which have christ on the screen are still moving. just about all of the acting is good with only a few forgettable moments. just be ready to spend about 4 hours in front of the screen listening to occasionally flowery dialog.
"when i first saw 'ben hur' i was 8 years old and hadn't seen many films  since we were hardly ever allowed to watch television. imagine what an impact this film had on me (my movie diet had so far consisted of chaplin and disney films - which  of course  is not at all a bad thing).the experience was simply mesmerizing. awe and wonder filled me as i watched this story of shocking betrayal  revenge and forgiveness unfold on screen - and by the time the heart-stopping chariot race was over  my fate as a future movie addict was sealed. despite its 212 minutes running time  this is storytelling at its finest that knows how to entertain; as we follow judah ben-hur's dramatic journey from jerusalem to rome and back again  the film just never lets up and immerses you completely.it's hard to imagine anything more cinematic  especially at the time: if ever there was an epic that was meant to be seen on the big screen in all its bombastic glory  it's ben hur. and even now  after i've seen the film many  many times  i feel like this story has a certain sense of greatness to it that is touching (and i don't mean that in a religious sense).my verdict: this film was and is nothing like the many ""sandal and sword"" or bible films of that era; it is (at least to me) the ultimate film epic. with its touching story and fantastic action sequences - which i think hold up amazingly well - ben hur is among the milestones of its era and part of film history.pure cinema and a must see. 10 stars out of 10.favorite tv-shows reviewed: imdb.com/list/ls075552387/favorite films: imdb.com/list/mkjokvqlsbs/lesser-known masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/favorite low-budget and b-movies: imdb.com/list/ls054808375/"
"i have a deep admiration for david lean as the director who pushed the boundaries of film making far beyond  and set the marker not only in technical aspects of the craft  but often in atmosphere and feel of the film. his movies are beautiful to watch and that's why sometimes we can't see how bad the cake tastes from all the icing and decorations. ""the bridge on the river kwai"" is like that  sticky sweet but ultimately nauseating. every time a movie parts from reality we observe a genre  and the intention of film maker  along with symbolism it's trying to project. war movies in particular have to be true to the bone (unless they're parodies) because they represent the bestiality of mankind  and duality of man. this film tried to portray those essential elements but fell into hollywood blender and came out silly and unrealistic.first and foremost  anybody who even remotely knows anything about japanese tradition  military culture social and military codes and character of japanese man  can only laugh at pitiful colonel saito who is not only without any remorselessness  but looks like a powerless teacher on the first day in a new school  being played like a flute by honorable colonel nicholson (alec guinness) who not only survives days  locked in a tin box in tropical heat and humidity  but wins every concession for his troops he can think of  making the poor colonel saito cry at the end of one of his parades of will?!? japanese soldiers and camp commanders were ""very well known"" for their compassion  sensitivity and sensibility which was expressed many times during the war  especially in wake island massacre  manila massacre and bataan death march  so even the hint of colonel nicholson's behavior would result in quick decapitation. william holden with his tanned biceps glowing in the sun is a true picture of starved japanese prisoner  and his escape  along with return through the jungle in 50's style loafers (observe the scene where he and his band of sturdy man are being washed by burmese women prior to attacking the bridge)  is down right preposterous. building a bridge as a monument to his ego is possible way of expression for ""open only in a case of war"" type of character col. nicholson apparently is  but convincing other prisoners to join in that venture simply on ""let's show 'em"" premise  in those times and circumstances is not likely to happen. to complete the three-ring circus  japanese soldiers show solidarity and play along  so at the end you're not sure what did you just see. the battle of wills  winner makes history film  anti-war film  or simply a hollywood action movie/spectacle without any plausibility or logic? judge for yourself. oh  and 5 stars are only for cinematography and holden's loafers."
"after years of more intimate british films and just discovering the joys of location shooting with 1955's ""summertime""  master director david lean made his first actual widescreen epic with 1957's ""the bridge on the river kwai""  an acknowledged classic that deserves attention from a new generation of viewers and another visit from the rest of us who love perfectly executed films by an unparalleled craftsman. recently  this movie has been overshadowed by his 1962 follow-up epic  the comparatively more elaborate ""lawrence of arabia""  but this richly textured wwii-set adventure is special enough on its own terms. while it has its share of action and suspense presented in exacting detail  the film is even more resonant as a psychological drama about the test of wills between mission-driven officers amid the perils of wartime survival.the plot takes place in 1943 when after surrendering in singapore  col. nicholson marches his ragged british company into a japanese prisoner work camp in the burmese jungle (this is where the famous whistling of ""colonel bogey march"" is first heard). the erudite col. saito runs the camp and demands that the new prisoners build a massive railway bridge  a critical juncture between rangoon and malaysia. in a classic stand-off  nicholson finally forces saito to respect geneva convention and not allow his officers to do manual labor on the construction. upon his ironic pyrrhic victory  nicholson slowly descends into the madness of seeing the completed bridge as a potential morale booster for his battle-weary men. meanwhile  shortly after nicholson's arrival  u.s. navy cmdr. shears escapes from the camp only to be later blackmailed into joining a british commando mission led by do-or-die maj. warden and hesitant lt. joyce with the sole goal of blowing up the bridge. through peter taylor's thoughtful film editing  the movie breathlessly alternates between the parallel story lines of the bridge construction and the jungle commando mission until the exciting climax.lean's accomplishments are many with this memorable film - the authenticity of the burmese jungle locations (filmed in sri lanka)  the seamless integration of the two story lines  the masterful handing of the final scenes  and in particular  the gradual metamorphosis of nicholson from a by-the-book british officer to saito's willing collaborator. a frequent participant in lean's films  alec guinness gives his career-best performance as nicholson providing all sorts of unexpected shades to his complex characterization. as shears  william holden does what he did best in the 1950's  concurrently exude natural bravado and a conflicted soul and then added a layer of cynicism that dares to challenge the viewer to support him. the 68-year old sessue hayakawa came out of retirement to play saito and delivers a subtle performance of unbending discipline and pained humiliation. jack hawkins and geoffrey horne lend sturdy support as warden and joyce respectively. with the same expert eye he lent to ""summertime""  jack hildyard provides the superbly expressive and composed cinematography. michael wilson and carl foreman  both blacklisted at the time  wrote the brilliantly developed screenplay. this is essential viewing.the two-disc 2000 limited edition dvd set has a pristine print transfer with great sound making the entire experience feel surprisingly fresh upon viewing. there is a nearly hour-long documentary on disc two  ""the making of the bridge on the river kwai""  produced for the dvd and full of intriguing insight into the production logistics. there are a couple of shorter featurettes produced around the time of the film's original release  the first is a black-and-white teaser for the film itself and the second a rather pedestrian lesson in film 101 produced by usc grad students and introduced by holden. director john milius provides a respectful tribute to the film in another short."
no need to echo consensus points  except to say the movie is indeed a powerhouse. instead  i'll offer a few side comments. the production took place during the mccarthy era. thus  i expect the catalytic role of father barry is no accident  appealing  as it does  to the aggressive anti- communist sentiments of the period. apparently  initial preferences were to make the union gangsters communists instead of real gangsters. for various reasons  the communist idea was shot down and we get johnnie friendly  instead. still  the religious message is spread on pretty thick by a forcefully effective karl malden as the working class father.in this same political vein  director kazan was never forgiven by large segments of the hollywood left for naming names before the huac sub-committee on communist influence in the us. apparently  he looked upon this movie as a defense of his role before the committee. after all  it's terry's (brando) willingness to testify about underworld control of the union that breaks their hold. but  of course  the movie couldn't end on a bland courtroom proceeding  so we get the powerful showdown on the docks  where terry undergoes a purifying beating for his earlier collaboration with friendly.it's hard to say enough about the effectiveness of the decision to film on actual dockside in new jersey. the uncompromising nature of that filming lends necessary grit to an explosive drama. note too the ongoing sounds of the waterfront that keep reminding us.maybe i missed something  but i can't understand why the mob killed charley (steiger) instead of terry once they knew terry would inform. after all  what's going to motivate a guy to retaliate more than killing his brother. charlie's dangling corpse does make for a powerful scene  as does terry and edie's expressionist flight down the shadowy alleyway. but the choice to kill charlie still seems murky to me.anyway  these are a few side remarks on a much reviewed film that remains an undiminished classic  even after 60-years.
"""on the waterfront"" is basically the story of one man  terry malloy  a young dock worker with a little  and unsuccessful  experience as a boxer but not much intelligence or purpose he wastes his time around the docks  vaguely discontented about his life and revealing a tender trace in his otherwise tough manner as he tends his pigeons caged on the roof of his modest building his brother charley (rod steiger)  a suave opportunistic lawyer  works for the local dockers' union  headed by johnny friendly (lee j. cobb)  the arrogant mob boss friendly takes affectionate interest in terry and tries to make things easy for him he also takes advantage of terry by involving him in the killing of an uncooperative docker unaware of their murderous intentions  terry sets the trap for the man who is thrown from a roof top because he allowed himself to be interviewed by a crime investigating commissionterry's alienation from the crooked union leaders starts when he meets the dead man's sister  edie (eva marie saint)  and realizes the grief he has brought into her life she asks his help in bringing the racketeers to justice  as does father barry (karl malden)  a priest of complete goodness and rightness brando's moral dilemma was superbly drawn in the film he's an ordinary man finding the courage to stand up and be counted as portrayed by brando he is touchingly believable the rest of the cast is excellent:cobb is extremely good as the brute fury boss who intimidates the workers into silence  stopping at nothing to maintain his position of power on the docks... rod steiger gives his finest performance as the clever and suave opportunistic lawyer who works for the local docker's union...eva marie saint manages to make the blood go through brando's valves reviving and creating a heart that never existed before... karl malden is hard and clear as the activist catholic priest who continue encouraging other longshoremen to testify  inciting brando to fight for his rightsregardless of the costrather than be a pawn in a ruthless system of bribes and killings... ""on the waterfront"" is one of the great american films  not only because it bravely spreads a strong light on the violation of justice  but because it is a powerful piece of cinema  which push forward a classic study of man's responsibility to his fellow man... the film won eight academy awards..."
"the setting is a dead end south american village in the middle of nowhere. its only distinguishing feature being an american oilfield some distance away from the village. but then an accident causes a fire to spread into the oil and the only way to stop it is to literally blow it out. with nitroglycerin. the only problem being that they don't have the safety equipment needed to transport the nitro from the village. but ""luckily"" such villages have no shortage of men at the end of their ropes  willing to do anything for a final paycheck.and that's essentially the wages of fear in a nutshell. it's about human desperation and about ever-mounting stakes as the tension keeps rising and rising. every little tremor or stone on the road could send all four men into the sky in a fiery explosion of primordial forces. and even though you're safely hunkered on your coach  behind the reality line of a tv screen  you can't help but sweat in anguish alongside these men. the film is that well shot.that being said  it takes its sweet time getting there. the first portion of the film is spent getting to know the village and these four wretched souls. and while they are interesting personalities  played by talented actors  it still drags quite a bit. and that's partly because at that point you don't have much of an idea where the film is going. most of the loose threads get tied up towards the end  but a good half of the film is a jumbled mess.but that other part where they're actually transporting the explosives is so good that it more than makes up for the weaker first half. recommended for all fans of intense."
"this movie is astonishing  a gritty story filmed in an ultra-real style that relies simply on the beauty of lighting and film to achieve its stunning effects. it seems from another world  which in a way  it is. the acting is superb: montand's mario is full of jerky movements and intense impulses but always maintains his gallic savoir-faire  while charles vanel as jo brings  at first at least  a type of macho to the screen that modern movie-makers simply do not comprehend. the rest of the cast  especially the camp chief  luigi  and peter van eyck as bimba are incredible  as is vera clouzot who is incomprehensibly but believably upbeat and innocent - and totally gorgeous - in the midst of the hellhole of a town they're all stuck in. clouzot's directing is flawless - i don't think anyone has ever squeezed more tension with just a few essential scene elements. the trucks wheeze and grunt as well as they ever have in the movies - the only comparison is spielberg's early gem  ""the duel""  but clouzot's automotive cinematics outdo even spielberg. the stripped down existentialism of the characters  the starkness of their shared dilemma  the grim and grimy scenery  and the cinematography itself are all of a piece. the latter is what elevates this movie to the very top rank  including some of the most dramatic and effective black and white shooting i've ever seen. yet it never becomes mannered or gratuitous - it is orchestrated with the rise - and rise! - of tension in the film. the final scene takes on a surreal as opposed to ultra-realistic quality that has its own logic. one last word about the acting - we don't see anything like it anymore. the self-conscious mannerism of method acting (which has had its own triumphs) and the toxic awareness of everyone from the actors to the audience  the camera  directors  etc. that each actor is a celebrity and potential artiste  has ruined that conviction that actors were once larger than life people before they went on-screen  that they came to acting as an outcome of living rough  unadorned  and yet imaginative lives as opposed to shooting for fame and fortune and celebrity within an artificial corporate star-making incubator."
"carol reed's ""the third man"" strikes all the right cords  establishing  itself on so many different levels that it almost becomes untouchable.  it has an underlying tone of darkness that not only thrills but chills.  it grabs the viewer from the start and never lets go.  it opens with anton karas' startling zither music and quickly propels  the viewer into a world of evil and lies. the tale is familiar to any  film lovers: a pulp western writer named holly martin (joseph cotten)  is invited to post-war vienna by an old friend of his  harry lime  (orson welles). the city has been divided into american  british   french and russian zones. the city exists as a shattered remnant of the  past - haunting and horrifying  dark and mysterious.   upon his arrival  holly discovers to his horror that his old college  pal is dead - hit by a car in the middle of a street. but for holly   the circumstances don't add up - everyone involved in the accident was  related in some way or another to harry. so holly searches for clues   much to the chagrin of the british officer calloway (trevor howard)   whose name is misused as callohan by holly many times throughout the  film. (""it's 'calloway ' mr. martin  i'm not irish."")  holly martin does begin to stumble upon some vital clues as to the real  story behind lime's death - and finds out more than he bargained for.  lime's old girlfriend is a stage actress. (""always comedy."") she  accompanies holly throughout the film  and we expect an underlying  romance to blossom  but yet in the end it does not - one of the many  surprises of the film.  i suppose it would be a sin for me to give away how harry lime  reappears  or even give away the fact that he does  for that matter  (though by now i am sure you realize orson welles is in this movie and  therefore turns out to be alive). but for those who have seen the film   we all remember that terrific scene where the cat meows  and suddenly  he appears  an evil smirk on his face like a child who has gotten away  with the cookie from the jar. and then the ferris wheel scene  and the  chase through the sewers that no doubt helped win the film an oscar for  cinematography. these are all some of the most memorable of film  scenes.  the director of ""the third man "" carol reed  stumbled upon the film's  musician  anton karas  one night in a trashy bar in vienna. it is no  wonder that out of all his candidates he chose karas - the film's tune  is literally the most perfect example of matching harmony between a  film and its music i have ever seen (although ""jaws"" is up there with  it). to go into the music is pointless - it must simply be heard in  synchronism with the film for you to understand where i am coming from.  when i think of film noir  ""d.o.a."" (1949) and ""the third man"" (1949)  are the first two films that come to mind. both accomplish what they  set out to do  but ""the third man"" exceeds even farther than the former  - it is haunting and almost poetically vibrant in the way it displays  its story and the outcome of its characters. it is a film that will be  around for years and years. ""citizen kane"" is often thought of as the  greatest american motion picture of all time. but if i had to choose  between the two  i would most likely choose ""the third man."" it's just  my opinion  of course  and many may not agree  but as far as i see   ""the third man"" beats ""citizen kane"" - for me - on more levels than  one.   welles' ""citizen kane"" (1941) was an artistic film that rarely used  close-ups. it would almost stand back from the scenes and let the  viewer focus on what he or she wanted to focus on. ""the third man"" has  many close-ups. i do not take this as a director trying to give the  audience what he wants them to see  but rather a director in touch with  his feelings and ideas. director carol reed knows just how to evoke  characters' feelings from scenes and close-up shots. the camera tilts  at awkward angles more often than not. the more and more paranoid and  afraid our hero becomes the more and more intense the close-ups and  angles. there is some haunting material in ""the third man "" some  material the most novice of filmgoers might not expect. and the music  and direction only makes it all the more terrifying and haunting. this  is a film that you must witness to believe.  5/5."
"i don't know why this movie always hooks me the way it does; it's obviously a masterpiece and a revered piece of british/american cinema - but that alone is not the reason (there are other such masterpieces which fail to have that effect on me). maybe it's the setting: the beautiful city of vienna right after world war ii  the scars of the most devastating conflict in human history still visible at every corner. or it's the contrast between the eerily happy music tune - which plays throughout the entire film - and the dark  tragic story of murder and betrayal which i find so strangely captivating. whatever it is  i just love this movie.'the third man' now has more than 60 years on its back  but its age hardly shows. despite the story's dark themes  the general mood of the narrative is rather light  sometimes darkly funny  and the slightly cynical tone and morally ambiguous characters give the movie a very modern feel. what also stands out and makes the film memorable - in addition to the fantastic soundtrack - is the outstanding  accademy award winning cinematography. black and white has rarely looked better. the way dop robert krasker plays with unusual angles and virtually ""paints"" this city of vienna with light and shadow  he adds an almost expressionistic quality to the film. i always felt that the city plays an essential part in the story  - a key character if you will - with its damaged buildings reflecting the damaged human characters. the recent war is a looming presence throughout the film  and to me this is as much a story about the desensitizing effect of war on people as it is a murder mystery. and there is yet another quality to the film which needs to be mentioned: it's very entertaining. 'the third man' has fantastic pacing and there is simply not a dull moment in it. to sum up my overall impressions  this is one of those rare occasions where everything just falls right into place and helps create a unique film experience: carol reed's masterful direction and the wonderful performances by the fantastic actors (joseph cotten  trevor howard  alida valli and orson welles); the beautiful soundtrack by anton karas; the gorgeous cinematography by robert krasker  and  perhaps most importantly  the story and screenplay by graham greene with its unexpected twists and turns (although the unusual  iconic ending wasn't greene's idea). a true work of art and highly enjoyable entertainment: 10 stars out of 10.favorite films: http://www.imdb.com/list/mkjokvqlsbs/lesser-known masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/favorite low-budget and b-movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/"
a stylishly directed and photographed film that examines a number of themes  such a deception  death and depression  and explores well the emotions of its characters. it is rare to find a film like this  as it tackles various genres  ranging from being a romance to a mystery to a drama to even a comedy at times  and all without seeming pretentious. the cast is truly magnificent. judith anderson is a stunner is a quiet but sinister role  and george sanders is even more impressive in lively but also sinister performance. laurence olivier and joan fontaine are perfect for their roles too. the film won academy awards for best picture and best cinematography quite deservingly  this is one of the best films hollywood has ever produced.
"hitchcock felt 'rebecca'  his first hollywood film  was a compromise  but as a viewer i just can't fault it. it's a masterpiece in my opinion  full of suspense  mystery and brooding atmosphere. it's also one of the most romantic movies i've ever seen. i've watched it several times over the years  and even now that i know all the plot twists and turns (quite shocking on your first viewing)  it never fails to hook me in. one of the reasons it really works is the flawless casting. i'm not much of an olivier fan but he's superb as de winter  with just the right mixture of charm and coldness. and joan fontaine is just perfect as de winter's new bride. i can't spot an unconvincing moment in her performance and can't imagine any other actress in the role. hitchcock subsequently used her in 'suspicion' with cary grant. she was also excellent in that but 'rebecca' is a much stronger movie. the supporting cast also includes some brilliant performances  especially judith anderson ('laura') as the extremely creepy mrs. danvers  george sanders who plays rebecca's slimy cousin  and nigel bruce in a typical role as de winter's bumbling brother-in-law major lacy. sanders subsequently worked again with hitchcock in 'foreign correspondent'  and bruce played cary grant's lovable pal ""beaky"" in 'suspicion'. i sometimes think that hitchcock's 1940s movies are overlooked by many because they are regarded as being too ""old fashioned""  but for me movies like 'suspicion'  'saboteur'  'lifeboat' and 'spellbound' are some of the most entertaining movies hitchcock ever made  and 'rebecca' is the best of the lot. if you want to be totally enthralled for two hours just watch 'rebecca'!"
through a series of fortunate  and unfortunate  events  an unsophisticated local hero  jefferson smith  is appointed a us senator. the people pulling the strings in his party and state figure that he will be compliant and malleable and basically stay out of the way of their plans  some of which aren't entirely ethical  or legal. however  a well-intentioned deed sets off a dramatic chain of events  a series of events that will see him at odds with his colleagues  with the shadowy  bullying powerbrokers and with the entire senate.brilliant movie from frank capra. while capra also gave us such great movies as it's a wonderful life  meet john doe and it happened one night  this is his greatest work. a superb indictment of politics and how democracy has been undermined and corrupted  told with the trademark capra brand of wholesomeness and practical idealism. considering how politics has even further degenerated since 1939  even more relevant today than when it was released in 1939.clever  engaging plot that doesn't waiver for a second. not an ounce of deadwood in the movie - every scene is perfect and important. some great twists and turns and some great tension towards the end as smith struggles to preserve his name and ideals. wonderful themes and morals too  as you would expect from frank capra.add in some excellent performances  especially from james stewart in the lead role and jean arthur as ms saunders. both received oscar nominations  as did harry carey for playing the president of the senate.in all  mr smith goes to washington was nominated for 11 oscars  including best picture  but won only one  for best original screenplay. unfortunately for it  the 1940 oscars belonged to a juggernaut known as gone with the wind...
james stewart and frank capra.  one needn't know much more going in to be assured that this will be an enjoyable film.  together they take on the washington elite with this dramatic comedy about a naïve washington outsider who gets appointed to the senate and stands alone against corruption and graft.  jefferson smith (james stewart) is appointed from an unnamed state after one of its senators dies.  he is appointed because the political fat cats need someone who will not seem like a crony  but who will not stand in the way of a graft scheme for a pork barrel dam that will make bigwig jim taylor (edward arnold) millions.  when the wide eyed smith gets to washington  he discovers the corrupt bill because the dam will stand in the way of his own proposed bill for a children's camp.  when he tries to stop the project  taylor's political machine frames him to make it seem like he is the one taking graft.  this leads to the dramatic confrontation in the senate  where smith filibusters in an attempt to get the truth out.this film is wonderful in so many ways.  the story is a classic struggle between good and evil.  in typical capra style  the protagonist and antagonists are exaggerated so there is no confusion as to who are the good guys and who are the bad guys.  if there is one clear message in capra's films it is that those with strong moral fiber never give up hope.  he likes to create utterly hopeless situations for characters to test their integrity  and rewards unswerving adherence to basic values and principles by triumph against the odds.  i was dismayed to see a comment  obviously from a young viewer of this film  that said that the characters weren't realistic because no one used profanity.  this is a sad testimonial to our culture  when it inconceivable to young people that there was once a time when profanity was the exception and not the rule. stewart is brilliant as the idealistic and awe struck kid from the backwoods who is overwhelmed by the glory of washington  with its monuments and history.  the story brings us a confrontation between political expediency and idealistic principles with the message that the truly great men are the ones that don't compromise their principles to hold on to power.  stewart also brings a whole treasure chest of bumbling comedic sight gags that make him all the more lovable in the part.jean arthur is fabulous as the tough and savvy assistant who is jaded by washington politics  but gets a fresh injection of fervor as she listens to smith's noble homespun philosophies.  claude rains is also masterful as the adulterated senator  who sold his soul to corruption for a chance at the presidency.  he plays the simultaneous sense of guilt and ambition with a torment that is clearly ripping his heart out  and the power of both emotions portrayed in his performance makes his character both repugnant and pitiable.this film is a national treasure.  it is in my top 50 list of all time.  the story of corruption in politics and the greatness of the men who resist it is timeless and would not be lost on the politicians in washington today.  a 10/10.
"i wish people made more movies like this nowadays..yes! the movie is long  but the development of the main character has you swinging from liking her to hating her  to agreeing with her  to.. all sort of emotions!! it is well worth anyone's time.
these characters feel so real! it's like a perfect summarized soap opera. anyone studying movie-writing should check this adaptation of the book. would recommend to anyone.and make yourself a favor and don't watch the sequel.. the movie ends the way it does for a reason."
"at first you would think  the main theme of the film is the horrors of war and the idea that both sides suffer   but that is not the only case in ""gone with the wind""  the war is just a background...
scarlet lives almost her entire life in an illusion of love... she has a target she want to achieve and she thinks if she achieves it she will be happy  while missing the point on the way to that target... something that i realised on a 2nd viewing is that scarlet is a pretty selfish person with sociopaths behaviour. she can easily manipulate men and sometimes women in order to achieve her goal. she can kill a person and not feel that bad about it she can exploit prisoners rather than hire free men. the goal is what pushes her forward and sometimes makes her do good things  but these deeds are never done out of big heart  they are usually done in self interest. you would think she ends up achieving everything she wanted  but she does not. scarlet lives in a personal hell which partially she created herself and only when the last obstacle to her big love  the female friend that loves her is gone  she realises that all this time  she lived the illusion of love  she was hurting the people that loved her. is scarlet a horrible person? probably... does she pay for her sins? she does more than anyone... does she understand what true love is? yes in the end she does... what makes this film so great  it's a tragedy like ""war and peace"" with monumental character development ...any scenes of war and racism fade compared to the tragedy of scarlet which lives in personal hell..."
"this sweet comedy never loses its appeal.  claudette colbert is a spoiled young girl who meets a wordly  attractive newspaper reporter (clark gable). in the beginning  she treats him like a servant  but he never knuckles under to this behavior.  the interaction between these two is very romantic and humorous.  it is the classic portrayal of what may be called ""sexual tension.""  he takes care of her - does not take advantage of her - but makes her realize that her wealthy background cannot carry her through as a human being  she has to earn his respect by treating him with respect.  there is a scene in which the two of them are forced to hitchhike  and their ""breakfast"" is only a handful of carrots plucked from a garden they were lucky to find.  as gable stands at the edge of the road and colbert is perched atop a wooden fence  his wisecracking posture is said to be the inspiration for the beloved cartoon character bugs bunny.  this is a must-see for every one who loves old movies  and entertaining for all."
in his autobiography  the name's above the title  frank capra said that until it happened one night drama had four stock characters  the hero  the heroine  the comedian  and the villain.what capra did and you might notice he followed that in a whole lot of his films  the characters of hero and comedian are combined. not completely though because claudette colbert gets a few laughs herself  especially with that system all her own. but in doing what he did for clark gable's character  capra created a whole new type of screen comedy  the classic screwball comedy and it happened one night surely set the mold.capra's autobiography told the story of the making of it happened one night which in itself could be a movie. capra worked for columbia pictures which at that time was a minor studio  along the lines of republic or monogram. as capra tells it he had a vision about this story that samuel hopkins adams wrote and persuaded harry cohn to buy it. capra also had a stroke of good luck. adolph zukor at paramount and louis b. mayer at mgm were looking to punish a couple of recalcitrant stars  claudette colbert and clark gable. the idea was to show these two what it was like to work in a small budget studio without all the perks of paramount and mgm. in fact the description of gable arriving to work at columbia that first day  drunk as a skunk  is priceless. capra dressed him down good and said that to his credit gable came to work afterwards and couldn't have been more cooperative.at some point harry cohn at columbia was convinced that maybe capra had something. he had in fact delivered for columbia the previous year with lady for a day. so the publicity drums were beat.the rest as they say is history. it happened one night won the first oscar grand slam  best picture  best director  best actor  and best actress. it won the first oscars columbia pictures ever got and lifted it right into the ranks of the major studios. and it set the standard for screwball comedy.the film could never have gotten off the ground were it not for the chemistry of gable and colbert. they're together for most of the film so if it doesn't click between the two of them  you have people walking out in droves. colbert had already played a wide variety of parts at paramount  ranging from poppaea and cleopatra to comedies with maurice chevalier like the big pond. gable had played a whole lot of tough guys on both sides of the law at mgm. it happened one night showed he had some real comic talent  a flair mgm exploited in his roles from then on in. gable and colbert did only one other film together  boom town for mgm. you can't get much more different than those two films. boom town had a huge mgm budget  spencer tracy and hedy lamarr as well  and a lot of special effects involving the oil industry and hazards therein. it's also a great film  but it's not a classic like it happened one night.
"i was completely floored when i first saw this movie in the basement of the san jose main library sometime in the early seventies. the mesmerizing performance of maria (renée) falconetti  filmed primarily as a series of brutalizing close-ups  is still the main reason to revisit carl theodor dreyer's austere and claustrophobic 1928 silent film classic about the trial and execution of joan of arc. there is little provided in the way of background or context  as dreyer made an intentional decision to use the original trial records as the basis of his dialogue. using a minimum of sets  almost abstract in orientation  he uses the camera frame as his canvas by showing the bullying interrogation of joan by her inquisitors in a series of face shots against a white backdrop. the actors had to use their make-up-free faces as their sole means of expression. there are never any establishing shots  so the viewer never knows where the characters are in relationship to each other. instead  dreyer uses dramatic camera angles to convey people's position in the story. as the film builds to its climax  graphic footage of joan being burned at the stake alternates with sequences of angry french peasants being brutally driven out of rouen castle by club-wielding english soldiers. many of the shots feel abstract and out of proportion to convey a world turned upside down.the overall effect of these creative and daring techniques gives the film a more contemporary feeling than a standard silent  and luckily  adding to the freshness of the treatment is a pristine print found in copenhagen  the basis of the transfer in this criterion collection dvd. an effectively stirring enhancement is richard einhorn's beautiful ""voices of light""  an oratorio specifically written to accompany the film decades after its release. falconetti was 35 when she played the 19-year old peasant girl  but she is entirely convincing using her large eyes and facial plains to build her character's spirit as it dwindles under the pressure of the french clergymen who rule her fate. one truly believes her assertion that she is a messenger for god. never to act on screen again  she gives a truly legendary performance deserving of the hosannas received over the years. the dvd contains an interesting commentary track on which dreyer scholar casper tybjerg provides a wealth of information. it also contains features on the film's unusually stylized production design  einhorn's music  and the checkered history of the many versions that ""the passion of joan of arc"" has gone through over the years. in spite of its unrelenting tone and some scenes that will make you wince  it's a masterwork that still resonates 77 years later."
carl th. dreyer's the passion of joan of arc was made  perhaps  years ahead of its time- my guess would be that if it wasn't burned after its initial release  it would've had as stunning an impact on the film world years down the line as citizen kane did. though the use of close-ups and distorted angles were not completely new in this film  it felt like dreyer was creating a new kind of cinema  one where reality  however cold and pitiful  was displayed with complete sincerity. there is also the editing (by dreyer and marguerite beague)  which has the timing that many directors/editors of the modern day could only hope to achieve (it has the influence of eisenstein  only in a totally different historical context)  and those moves with the camera by rudolph mate (who would go on to photograph foreign correspondent and lady from shanghai) that are precious- to call his work on the film extraordinary is an understatement.and it was crucial for dreyer to use the close-ups and tilted angles and shots where you only see the eyes in the bottom of the frame  and so forth- he's developing the perfect atmosphere in regards to a trial set in 15th century france. it's all those eyes  all those faces  holding all those stolid mindsets that send joan to her fate. pretty soon a viewer feels these presences from all these people  so strong and uncompromising  and dreyer does a miraculous thing- he makes it so that we forget about the time and place  and all of our attention is thrown onto those eyes of joan  loaded to brim with a sorrow for where she is  but an un-questionable faith in what she feels about god. i wondered at one point whether dreyer was making as much a point on people's faiths and prejudices in the almighty  or just one on basic humanity.there have been many before me who have praised falconetti's performance to the heavens (kael called it the finest performance in film)  but in a way it almost can't be praised enough. what she achieves here is what ebert must've felt watching theron in the recent 'monster'. i didn't even see her in a performance as joan of arc- i saw her as being the embodiment of it  as if falconetti (with dreyer's guidance) took joan out of the pages of the trial transcript and her entire soul took over. there is something in an actor that has to be so compelling  so startling  and indeed so recognizable  that a person can feel empathy and/or sympathy for the person the actor's playing. all a viewer has to do is stare into falconetti's eyes in any shot  close-up or not  and that viewer may get stirred to boiled-down emotion. for me  it was almost too over-whelming an emotional experience- when joan is about to get tortured  for example  i found myself completely lost from where i was watching the film  everything in my soul and being was with joan in that chamber  and for a minute i broke out in tears. that's the kind of effect that dreyer's craft and all the acting work (including eugene sylvain as the bishop cauchon  and of course artaud as jean) can have on a viewer. i'm not saying it has to  yet the passion of joan of arc could- and should- be considered a milestone in cinematic tragedy  where the images that come streaming forth never leave a viewer  and the detail for time and place becomes just that  a detail for the main stage. love joan or hate her  this is for keeps.
the circus was both my first silent film and the first film i've watched by charles chaplin. being my first silent film i thought for sure i would be bored to death  but was i wrong. the film was really funny  made me laugh out loud. the comedy in this film is very different to the comedy in films now a days. now a days most comedy films are big on the special effects and just lame humor. in the circus the actors have actual talent  they have to be very good at showing there emotion  like facial expressions and things like that.i was amazed on how well the movie was  charlie chaplin is great and i hope soon i can get my hands on some more of his films. i almost wish they could make a films like this today just maybe with some color  i think it'd be a great idea.
"the circus (united artists  1928) written  produced  directed and starring charlie chaplin  is a well-documented gem about circus life  mixing comedy and sentiment in the best chaplin tradition  ranking this one of his finer yet neglected achievements of the 1920s.in it  chaplin plays a tramp who drifts at the midway of the circus after being wrongly accused of a theft and chased by a policeman. his escapades are mistaken as part of the act  which stirs roars of laughter from its audience. because his circus has not been earning any profits  the ringmaster/owner (allan garcia) decides in hiring charlie as his top attraction. however it is learned that charlie is only funny whenever he blunders to his viewing public. charlie soon learns from the abused merna (merna kennedy)  how valuable he really is  thus  making demands of quitting to his employer unless he ceases mistreating his stepdaughter  and offers him a higher salary  which he does. all goes well until rex (henry crocker)  ""king of the high wire "" joins the circus and becomes attracted to merna  causing charlie to vie for her affections any which way he can.with the circus being one of the more famous backdrops of many movie comedians and/or comedy teams ranging from w.c. fields to laurel & hardy  the marx brothers to martin and lewis  the circus stands out more for its ingenious use of difficult gags  comic timing and the effort that went into it to make every gag funny as well as realistically done. rarely seen since its original theatrical release  the circus came into full view again shortly after chaplin's death in 1977. newly scored and restored by chaplin himself in 1968 (as mentioned in the new opening titles)  with his singing of ""swing little girl"" recorded on the soundtrack during the opening credits  my first experience with the circus was in 1980 at new york city's regency theater  68th street and broadway  where the revival theater (which no longer exists  having been demolished in 1998) paid a tribute to chaplin with a series of shorts and features  including the kid (1921)  modern times (1936) and the great dictator (1940). being surrounded by an appreciative audience laughing at a silent film made long ago indicated d the circus has stood the test of time and what a comic genius chaplin was  especially when demonstrating how difficult performing comedy can be as his character finds he has to be funny and isn't  and at the same time showing how poor he is as a comic to the circus staff and how funny he is as a bad comedian to the movie audience. while sitting in the dark movie theater of all ages at the regency  the biggest laughs occurred during the opening as chaplin hides from the law inside a fun house surrounded by mirrors and later making a fool out of the rival pickpocket (steve murphy) as they each attempt to fool the policeman by pretending to be movable statues; charlie's encounter with a lion while locked inside the cage; and the biggest topper of all being charlie doing a tight rope wire act and trying to balance himself while loose monkeys crawl all over him  thus disrupting his act. these same gags obviously brought forth many laughs in 1980 as it did in 1928  and continue to do so today. in between these gags comes pathos  which chaplin also succeeds without hurting the continuity.chaplin staff players regulars such as harry bergman as the clown  and stanley sanford as the head property lead fine support. others in the cast include betty morrissey as the vanishing lady; george davis as the magician; john rand  albert austin and heinie conklin in smaller roles.in spite of its true greatness  it's hard to believe how underrated the circus has become  not having the appreciation as chaplin's own masterpieces  the gold rush (1925) and city lights (1931)  even by chaplin himself. it's been said that during the making of the circus  chaplin was going through personal problems of his own  including divorce and the passing of his mother. it's even more ironic the elimination of the circus from chaplin's own autobiography published in 1964 while his other works were profiled to great extent  regardless of his nomination as best actor and best comedy director by the academy for 1927-28 awards. at least this has been amended through its reissue throughout the years to a new generation of movie lovers.distributed onto video cassette as part of the chaplin centennial collection in 1989  the circus  currently on dvd  made its presence known on television in the height of cable television  notably on the weekly series  ""dead comics society"" on the comedy channel hosted by kevin kline around 1989-90  followed by american movie classics (1997-2000) and turner classic movies where it made its debut in 2003.the circus  a 70 minute comedy  is a fine study to film students and anyone appreciating and supporting the art of silent comedy.

"i would have eventually gotten around to watching this film  but my curiosity was piqued when i saw that it had miraculously jumped to number #17 on the 2007 version of afi's top 100 movies of all time list. it didn't make the cut at all for the original compilation in 1997  so even before seeing the picture  i had to wonder what might have affected movie critics in the intervening decade to reach this conclusion. i usually line up with the majority in most cases  but i have to admit  i don't quite get it with this picture. i found it entertaining enough on occasion  but i never got the sense that it was one of the great comedy classics of all time the way it's heralded on the dvd sleeve. i don't think the civil war lends itself much to comedy  so right there my expectations were greatly reduced. keaton's somber demeanor and generally stone faced disposition don't help. on the flip side  i wouldn't have expected slapstick to move the story along either  so at least i wasn't disappointed in that regard.what i did enjoy were some rather offbeat moments that showed genuine creativity. when johnnie gray (keaton) dejectedly considered his rejection by the confederate army  and pondered his situation while sitting on the train's connecting rod  the resulting visual was pure genius. the up and down motion lent a truly surreal juxtaposition to johnnie's thoughtful reverie  and was one of the highlights of the picture for me.the other significant scene that gave me pause was when the texas collapsed on the burning rock river bridge. for starters  i found it unbelievable that a wooden bridge could possibly be constructed strong enough to support a locomotive. then i came to learn that the scene was the most expensive ever made for a silent film  and i have to give keaton credit for going out on that kind of a limb - unbelievable.oh yes  and i can't forget the sequence where keaton's marksmanship is dead on when he makes contact with the rail tie blocking the train tracks  flipping it out of the way with a well timed throw of his own. could that have possibly been done in one take? in a pre-cgi world  it's difficult to imagine how stunts like these could have been performed  particularly by an actor who had no recourse but to do his own. for that  keaton deserves accolades.in between all this clever film making however  i just wasn't inspired. the central plot element doesn't hold up for me - if johnnie gray was rejected as a volunteer  why wasn't he simply told the reason why. one could argue that then  you wouldn't have a picture  but for me it left the story on a shaky footing. if johnnie was more valuable as a train engineer than a soldier  the picture might have taken a different approach  but the rest of the elements could have remained the same and he still would have come out a hero. maybe i'm second guessing a master  but that's what i come away with.conclusion - if this movie didn't make afi's top 100 film list in 1997  i don't understand what might have occurred in the intervening years to suddenly have film critics vault it into the top 20. at the same time  chaplin's ""city lights""  in my estimation a superior silent film  fell off the list  while ""the gold rush"" moved up a few notches. i may not be a professional  but i know what i like  and this one just didn't do it for me."
"buster keaton once said that if he hadn't been a comedian  he might have been a civil engineer. he was not only a mechanical whiz but a spatial genius who devised stunts and gags with the grace of pure physics. it's no wonder he adored trains  the most elegant of machines  and brought them into his movies whenever he could. when one of keaton's former gag-writers loaned him a book recounting the theft of a locomotive from georgia by union raiders during the civil war  he was immediately fired with enthusiasm to bring this ""page of history"" to life. his first certainty was that the production had to be ""so authentic it hurts."" he even insisted on using historically accurate narrow-gauge railroad tracks  which he found  along with appropriate landscapes  near the sleepy town of cottage grove  oregon.most importantly  the area had stretches of parallel tracks  which allowed scenes of buster on his train-agilely scrambling over the cars  balancing on the roof to scan the horizon  chopping wood for the engine while armies pass unnoticed behind him-to be filmed from another train running alongside. buster  his train  and the camera are all in motion; the wind whips through buster's hair while smoky pine-covered hills rise and fall around him. these scenes are not only the highlight of the movie but a peak in the history of *moving* pictures  and they put to shame all later back-projection and process shots  models and computer-generated effects. the quality of keaton's film-making is simply-pun intended-unparalleled. every shot in the general is clean  fresh and efficiently composed; the action is captured honestly and legibly at all times. the film never tries to be beautiful; its beauty is functional  just like the grave  masculine beauty of the locomotives and railroad bridges and civil war uniforms.the general's narrative structure is as strong and uncluttered as its look. like a train  it stays on track  never meandering for the sake of a laugh or a stunt. all of the gags rise organically from the coherent and straightforward storyline. adapting the historical incident  keaton made himself the engineer of the stolen train (johnnie gray)  rather than one of the raiders. as he saw immediately  the general is one long chase  or rather two chases  structured like the flight of a boomerang. first johnnie on a borrowed train  the texas  chases his own stolen train  the general. he manages to steal it back and races it towards his own lines  pursued by the raiders in the texas  who try to prevent him from carrying their battle plans to his own high command.the general is not keaton's funniest film  but here he was going for quality over quantity in laughs. a number of the gags  like the box-car that keeps appearing and disappearing as it switches tracks  have a long build-up for a relatively modest payoff. but the laughter is mingled with a gasp of awe  and the best moments never get stale on repeated viewings. the cannon attached to the back of buster's train goes off just as the train starts around a curve  so the ball flies straight and hits the raiders' train coming out of the curve. riding on the cowcatcher  buster hurls one railroad tie at another lying across the tracks  striking it precisely so that it flips out of the way. a forlorn buster sits on the crossbar of his train's wheels  so lost in thought he doesn't notice when the train starts to move  carrying him up and down in gentle arcs: stillness in motion.i agree with author jim kline who describes the general as keaton's most personal film  the one that best captures his unique vision  spirit and personality. in many of his films  buster starts off as an inept or effete character and develops into a hero. but his competent  ingenious and athletic character in the general  who is also modest  tireless  and underestimated  comes much closer to his real nature. there is a shot in the general of buster's eye isolated on screen  framed by a hole in a white table-cloth  that has always reminded me of dziga vertov's kinoglaz  the ""camera-eye."" keaton melds with his camera; there's no distinction between his qualities as a performer and the qualities of his movies. they have the same silence  the same strictness  the same strange blend of gravity and humor.the general might be the most serious comedy every made  but it's not a tragicomedy. that  as in chaplin's blending of pathos and low humor  was something people took to immediately. but no one knew what to make of the general. original reviews accused the film of being dull  pretentious  unoriginal  and unfunny. even today  people who have heard it acclaimed as one of the greatest movies of all time are sometimes puzzled or disappointed by it on first viewing. the general is challenging because it doesn't flaunt its virtues; like keaton's concise and economical performance  it holds a great deal in reserve. take the movie's most famous shot  of a train crashing through a burning bridge  for which keaton built a real bridge and destroyed a real train. the shot lasts a few seconds in the finished film: he doesn't dwell on it or hype it. who else in hollywood would sink money in a spectacular effect and then downplay it? keaton never forces a response from the audience  never manipulates  never overplays. he doesn't show off his acrobatic skills or his enormous repertoire of comic talents  nor does he play for sympathy. anything so subtle will always leave some people cold. but for those who can see the expressiveness of buster's so-called ""stone face "" who get his peculiar dry humor  who appreciate the rigorous purity and taste he displayed  these virtues are all the more stunning because they are understated. buster keaton always has more than he's showing; you can see it in his eyes."
"as a person who'd just finished reading the book on which ""the help"" is based and who'd just watched the film  i'd like to say a few things about the differences between the book and the film and how that reflected on the story.the film represents a much shorter version of the story than the book. the major differences  and the ones that i thought were not beneficial for the story  are as follows.constantine's daughter is black  not white  like in the book  and all her background story is missing. this is not ok  because skeeter's mum's reaction to her sudden appearance in the house in this case is hardly clear.skeeter's mum tells hilly off when she comes to her house  something that she didn't do in the book since she didn't even know about the book. the character of skeeter's mum  like it's done in the book  would have never understood the her daughter's book and would have never been proud of her daughter the way she is in the film.also in the book skeeter decides not to write about her mother had done. in the film she does.it's not also really clear that skeeter's mum has cancer and that she's really ill.aibeleen doesn't get a job in the magazine  like she does in the book  which i think is a shame because it represents new beginnings for her in the book. in the film she is basically left with nothing.then there is minny and miss celia. minny actually saves her life when she calls a doctor when celia has a miscarriage. in the film mr. johnny just says  ""she got better after minny appeared in the house""  which in my opinion is sort of strange and doesn't explain at all why he says that she had saved her life and why he is so grateful to her and offers her the job for the rest of her life. it is therefore very unconvincing in the movie  when he does that. incidentally  celia in the book also never ever learned how to cook.also  the whole ominous atmosphere in celia's house  the air of mystery is absent from the film  which is a shame  as well as her frequent miscarriages (only one is shown and very briefly  without showing minny's involvement  which is crucial) as well as minny's constant fear of johnny.it is also not shown that minny is actually really scared to lose her job when the book comes out.now  to aibeeleen's son. in the movie he's ""killed"". by whom? for what? we don't know. in this case i think it would have been better to leave it the way it was in the book – that his death was an accident. i can see what the film creators were trying to do  but it didn't quite work.also  in the church when they congratulate aibeleen on what she has done  they don't even lock the door – a small detail that would have shown  how much they are all still scared  which  i think  is important.what i find is also quite important to the story and something that was hardly if at all shown in the film is skeeter's social isolation after her fall-out with hilly. that's the cost she paid for disagreeing with everyone else in town and for trying to do something about it.also  how skeeter's mother constantly criticized her is not shown  which would have added comic value to the film but also explained why skeeter was so attached to constantine. the story with elisabeth  how she'd never really liked her child mae mobley and never treated her well is also omitted from the film. it would have been much more painful to watch aibeleeen leave the family if we knew what she meant for little mae mobley.what was also different from the book but what i did like  was the cause of the conflict between minny and hilly  which was sort of unclear in the book: hilly just started telling everyone else that minny had stolen silver from her for no apparent reason rather than she wanted minny to work for her. so i find that the thing with the bathrooms in the film actually works better.what i also liked was the way the characters were cast  especially the character of hilly  as well as minny and aibeeleen.and the way love affair with stuart was shown also worked well - it was much shorter than in the book  however the filmmakers managed to grip the essence of their relationship in a few scenes.all in all  good effort. but the book is even better - more multi- layered and more powerful."
"if this film were total fiction bearing no relation to reality  it would still be worth seeing for the fine acting and production values--even if some of the young white women approached ""southern gothic."" but it wasn't fiction--at least  the depiction of southern society wasn't. as i watched i kept drifting back to small-town south carolina in the 1950s  where i grew up. it was moving and disturbing to be reminded how black people were treated then--loved and yet ""kept down in their place."" our neighborhood was all middle-class and every family had a maid. there were plenty of boys my age  we visited in each other's homes  and called every maid by her first name. one even started a baseball team for the little white boys  for which her reward was a visit by the klan.our maid helped my mother cook and clean. one of my parents picked her up and took her home every day--and she rode in the back seat. she ate her lunch in our kitchen--without being allowed to use our utensils. i remember her eating with her fingers. i do not remember ever seeing her use our bathrooms. i thought about that during the movie and truly cannot recall what she did  an embarrassing gap in memory.i do remember when my father was out of work and our maid had to be cut back to three days a week. i actually cried; she was a member of our family. when talk about civil rights began in the late 1950s  my mother became annoyed at our maid for getting ""uppity."" and so it went. we moved to central florida in 1961  where there were no maids.travel back in time with this film. it's quite real  and i highly recommend it."
"pixar. with only seven movies you've built yourself a reputation as the greatest current animation studio of them all. dreamworks has made some good ones and 20th century fox's movies have made me chuckle a bit  and disney has gone downhill in recent years. but you can consistently produce quality work with almost no stain on your track record (except a bug's life  the one pixar movie i did not enjoy). but i've lost track of my thoughts.i'm here to talk about monster's inc.  my personal favorite pixar movie.i'm a doodler myself  and wan't to be an animator someday. and i love drawing monsters. weird looking  many armed  strange-eyed creatures. that may have been the 1st reason monster's inc. appealed to me. so many of these creatures looked like something i would draw  and i spent much of my movie time looking at the creatures in the background.i also was captivated by the world that was created in inc. a big problem for me in pixar's newest movie cars was lack of real explanation for their universe  like how they built their buildings. in monster's inc. the monster world is explained so much more in depth  and we really believe this world could exist. there's a beauty in watching the thousands of closet doors zoom around and i always get goosebumps from watching the ""scare montage""  because i now know the mechanics of the world these creatures live in. the characters in the world are also incredibly well realized. mike and sully both are easily relatable to  and even small characters have feelings and motivations we can understand. ""boo"" actually behaves like a young child would  and that helped me believe she had real emotions. but the creature randall is what stole the show for me. with his many arms  chameleon-like ability and sheer voice presence  it was hard for me to keep my eyes off of him. but what really made me love this movie so was the characters. when it comes time for the ""sad part"" of this movie  i was sad. i was actually seeing an animated cartoon that managed to make me feel for these animated creatures without being emotionally manipulative. and i'm not afraid to admit that i cry 4 out of 5 times at the ending.so  in the end  i can't recommend this film enough. i think this stands above all other pixar productions and is definitely one of the best animated films i've had the pleasure of seeing."
i thought billy crystal and john goodman were great. i like them anyway  but i can't imagine anyone else in their roles. john goodman comes across as a warm  fuzzy teddy bear type in so many of his roles  and this time he was actually drawn that way. crystal and goodman were great together  even when their characters showed signs of not getting along. and boo sounded so natural  so childlike. there's no way an adult could have done her lines the way they were executed.and the writing was so intelligent  this movie was not just for kids. there were a lot of clever jokes that kids might not get. still  the warm and fuzzy qualities of so many of the monsters make this a perfect choice for kids as well as adults  and i really don't get why abc couldn't give this a tv-g rating. it may have been a little violent or scary at times  but never all that intense. kids see worse on saturday morning.
"the 31st animated disney classic is one of disney's best known movies. it also takes us to a whole new world  a new fantastic point of view. this one takes place in saudi arabia. i've always liked this movie.""aladdin"" is very entertaining and great fun. it is hilarious  creative  imaginative and romantic. it isn't a faultless movie  but it's a little difficult not to like it.i'll start by talking about the characters. the blue genie is  without a doubt  the most amusing  hilarious  imaginative and genial genie ever created. robin williams steals the show as the genie's voice. with his incredible talent to do voices  he's hilariously awesome and fantastic as the genie's voice (and also as the voice of the enigmatic merchant that appears at the beginning  who happens to be an interesting character).iago is the funniest character of this movie  along with the genie. nobody better than gilbert gottfried to voice the sarcastic parrot. iago is simply hilarious! he's rude  grumpy  sarcastic  hungry for power  malicious  obnoxious and foul-tempered. he has an irritating voice but in a funny way  as well as a great talent to perfectly mimic other characters's voices. however  deep down inside he has a heart. i also love his hate for crackers. i don't see why does he hates crackers so much  but that also makes him so funny! besides  a parrot with teeth?? lol!jafar is a great villain. although often calm and humorous (for example  he keeps calling ""prince abooboo"" to ""prince ali"")  he also represents the worst and most ambitious kind of villain and he is one of the most dangerous disney villains. and he does possess a snake-like tone of voice sometimes.princess jasmine  what can i say? have you ever seen a more beautiful disney princess? she's just gorgeous! despite her strong and challenging personality  i like her anyway.the sultan is a funny dude. the magic carpet is lovable  one of my favorite characters from the movie. aladdin himself is a nice guy  poor but kind-hearted (although dishonest  immature and selfish sometimes).abu is funny mostly because of his vocal sounds  very donald duck-like. the cave of wonders is an amazing character. it is a giant tiger's head with an absolutely fantastic and brutal deep-throat voice.""aladdin"" is a festival of magic  special effects  bombastic humor and jokes.by the way  i absolutely love the song ""a whole new world"". the version sung by aladdin and jasmine is great  but the original version of peabo bryson and regina belle is better  deeper and more romantic and classic. it's a very romantic and joyful song  which is always a pleasure to listen. ""arabian nights"" is a nice song as well...i'd only wish that ""aladdin"" hadn't become a victim of its own success. it inspired 2 sequels and several stories with these characters.this should definitely be on top 250."
"aladdin is such an awesome move that still gets me excited to this day  i remember when i was 7 and i saw this in the theater and i just had so much fun. i am such a dork  i still love a lot of the disney movies that i loved as a kid  but i think the reason that i love aladdin so much is because this is one of the last disney movies that was hand drawn animation  the reason i love hand drawn animation is because it feels more personal and that the crew put their heart and soul into it  you can tell by watching it. they got a great cast of voice actors including scott weinger from full house and the always entertaining and hilarious robin williams. robin was just a perfect choice for genie  he brought a lot of energy to the movie and makes the genie a great character. who knew that a kid's version of the arabian nights tale could be so great? this is a great disney movie that i guarantee you're going to love.on a dark night  when jafar attempts to access the cave of wonders  a magical cave which holds treasures beyond the wildest belief  above all is a magical oil lamp containing a genie is hidden. he and his talking parrot  iago  learn that the only one who can enter the cave of wonders is the metaphorical ""diamond in the rough"". meanwhile  in the palace of agrabah  jasmine  the beautiful teenage daughter of the sultan  must be married before her upcoming birthday  but she rejects every prince she meets  as she wants to be married for true love and not merely for wealth. later  jasmine  frustrated with having her life lived for her climbs over the palace walls  and sees the marketplace for the first time  where she meets the street urchin aladdin and his monkey  abu  and the two young people are seen to be falling for each other. jafar uses a machine to see that the ""diamond in the rough"" is aladdin. jafar sends a group of guards to capture aladdin while jasmine is still with him. jasmine tells jafar to release him  but jafar lies and tells her he is already dead. jafar  disguised as an elderly man  releases aladdin from prison and leads him to the cave of wonders. they are told by the tiger-shaped head of the cave to touch nothing but the lamp. aladdin enters the cave and encounters a magic carpet before finding the lamp. abu tries to steal a ruby and causes the cave to start collapsing  but the carpet helps them to the entrance. jafar takes the lamp from them and tries to kill them but abu takes the lamp back and bites his arm  causing him to knock abu back into the cave just as it collapses. when aladdin awakens  abu gives him the lamp which he had snatched from jafar. after rubbing it  a genie is unleashed  revealing that he will grant aladdin three wishes. aladdin dupes the genie into freeing them from the cave without using up a wish. while contemplating his wishes  aladdin asks the genie to make him into a prince so he can marry jasmine. iago later steals the genie's lamp back and brings it to jafar  who becomes the genie's new master and uses his first wish to become sultan. jafar then wishes to become a powerful sorcerer  jafar then keeps the sultan  the genie  and jasmine as his slaves. aladdin must figure a way to save all of them and make things right again.aladdin is just a great movie that i promise you'll love  it has great characters  beautiful animation  and a terrific and catchy soundtrack that you'll be singing all day. this was one of the rare disney movies that you pretty much loved all the characters  even iago who is voiced by gilbert gottfried  the voice is a bit much but he is great as well. i personally love both the carpet and the genie. who knew that a carpet could have so much personality? i absolutely adore the ""friend like me"" scene  it was incredible to watch and had terrific animation! if for some odd reason you haven't somehow seen this movie  i highly recommend that you do  this will probably go down in your favorites as well.10/10"
it was funny to read that this film nearly avoided coming to our screens. with many number of studios rejecting the script and story  terminator was nearly terminated before getting of the ground. however  one company  orion pictures  the last resort for this movie  loved the premise of a robot running around as a man  trying to kill the mother of the savior of planet earth. thank goodness they saw that it was a good script  because it become one of the great films of the 1980's.in 2029  giant super computers dominate the planet  hell bent on exterminating the human race! and to destroy man's future by changing the past they send an indestructible cyborg  a terminator  back in time to kill sarah connor  the woman who's unborn son will become mankind's only hope. can sarah protect herself from this unstoppable menace to save the life of her unborn child? or will the human race be extinguished by one mean hunk of mutant metal?well this film is a real blast. the cast is extraordinary. this is probably arnold schwarzenegger's most popular role. i cannot see why it isn't. he was great as the cyborg that was walking around  as a killing machine. his facial expressions are sketched in my memory for life. i love the scene where see a close of his face in the police car  it was brilliant. schwarzenegger  originally a body builder  he has had a wonderful career in the movie industry. his other great films include predator  end of days  total recall  eraser and was impressive in his role as mr. freeze in batman and robin. his career was on hold for sometime a while back  due to injury  but he is back and i hope we get to see more of his acting talents.then you have the others in the cast. the other stand out in this film for me is linda hamilton. she was suited perfectly to the role of the feeble sarah connor  who is going to be the mother of the child who is going to save the world. hamilton has had a mixed career  with her filmography including the enjoyable dante's peak. the good guy in terminator was michael biehn  who played out the role of sarah connor's protector  reese kyle. he was very good in his role. his other movies include aliens  the rock  crash and an uncredited role in the great musical  grease. the director of terminator  namely james cameron  did a great job with this film. considering he thought up the idea from a sick bed  had it rejected that many times  it is a great credit to him. most directors would have given up on it  but he stuck with it till he got to our screens. thank goodness he did. the story of the terminator is an interesting one. it has a very biblical feel to it. one man sent to help save the world  with the initials j.c.  fascinated me immensely. cameron and co writer gale anne hurd did a fantastic script for this film. there are some unbelievable scenes in this movie. none more so then the vision we see of the metal cyborg walking from the truck fire. the vision we see from this scene is one of the main reasons why we have the terminator. james cameron explained that he wanted a scene in a movie that has a machine walking from a fire in menacing fashion. he got this spot on  if you ask me. then there are some other great scenes such as the tense stand offs that the evil cyborg has with all the humans he comes into contact with  including the first confrontation with sarah  in addition to the meeting he has with reese. i also enjoyed the scene where he goes through the police station. of course this scene has one of hollywood's most famous lines in it  that of arnie's 'i'll be back'  a classic. the final confrontation between sarah and the cyborg is another tension filled scene of this great movie.so  what more can i say about this movie? it is simply brilliant. i have asked many people their opinion on this film. one such response about it was  that is too 'eightish'  and that comment is fair enough. if you have the chance  grab a copy of terminator on dvd  as it is a great 2 disc set. i must admit the first time i saw it  i did not appreciate terminator like i do now. perhaps i found it a tad violent  but that is to be expected of a film that is called terminator. this movie was a great success and deserved to be with all the great work that was put into it. however more was to come  a film that was to become one of the greatest sequels in movie history. arnie was to deliver on his promise of 'i'll be back'!rating: 4.5 stars or 9/10
"is there a better person to play a cyborg than arnold?  for this movie he was a massively built oak tree of a man.  his strange accent makes for a perfect callous robotic sounding killing machine.  it's almost like his voice is a computer read out ( which i guess it is in one sense ). terminator is one of those films that started something huge.  people didn't realize it at the time  but the careers of arnold  cameron and perhaps even guys like micahel biehn  lance henriksen and even bill paxton were substantially started because of this film.  and cameron must have liked working with them so much that he gave all of them substantial roles in his next film ( aliens ).as we all know what the story is  i'll just tell you a bit about what is so fascinating about it.  first i have to mention michael biehn.  he has the real starring role.  he is the character that has to explain everything to the audience.  he has to explain this complicated story so that we know what is happening and why.  it is not an easy job to do something like that and still come off looking all right.  but biehn is simply awesome in this film. a microcosm of his performance can be seen when sara bites him.  biehn ( kyle reese ) replies "" terminator's don't feel pain.  i do.  don't do that again. ""  that is such a great line delivered with the perfect expression  the perfect tone and the perfect timing.  biehn is perfect for the role.this is also the first film that i saw as a youngster that ever warned me of the dangers of nuclear war and of the rapid advancements of machinery. perhaps i was too young and naive to fully understand all that james cameron was trying to say  but now that i am older  i can honestly say that the two terminators are perfect anti nuke films.  and they are so passionate with what they have to say.  i like it when a film has something to say.  i enjoy being entertained in the process but if you can manage both then you have a masterpiece.  this is a masterpiece.finally. there are two other reasons to enjoy this film.  one  this is the first film where ""i'll be back"" was spoken.  now it is part of arnolds vernacular.  secondly  bill paxton is in it.  and he adds spark to any film that he's in.  especially here  as the idiot punk leader that really gets the hell beat out of him  he has some great lines.a great film."
